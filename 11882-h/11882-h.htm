    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. &mdash; HAROLD QUARITCH MEDITATES
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are things and there are faces which, when felt or seen for the
      first time, stamp themselves upon the mind like a sun image on a
      sensitized plate and there remain unalterably fixed. To take the instance
      of a face&mdash;we may never see it again, or it may become the companion
      of our life, but there the picture is just as we <i>first</i> knew it, the
      same smile or frown, the same look, unvarying and unvariable, reminding us
      in the midst of change of the indestructible nature of every experience,
      act, and aspect of our days. For that which has been, is, since the past
      knows no corruption, but lives eternally in its frozen and completed self.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are somewhat large thoughts to be born of a small matter, but they
      rose up spontaneously in the mind of a soldierly-looking man who, on the
      particular evening when this history opens, was leaning over a gate in an
      Eastern county lane, staring vacantly at a field of ripe corn.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a peculiar and rather battered looking individual, apparently over
      forty years of age, and yet bearing upon him that unmistakable stamp of
      dignity and self-respect which, if it does not exclusively belong to, is
      still one of the distinguishing attributes of the English gentleman. In
      face he was ugly, no other word can express it. Here were not the long
      mustachios, the almond eyes, the aristocratic air of the Colonel of
      fiction&mdash;for our dreamer was a Colonel. These were&mdash;alas! that
      the truth should be so plain&mdash;represented by somewhat scrubby
      sandy-coloured whiskers, small but kindly blue eyes, a low broad forehead,
      with a deep line running across it from side to side, something like that
      to be seen upon the busts of Julius Caesar, and a long thin nose. One good
      feature, however, he did possess, a mouth of such sweetness and beauty
      that set, as it was, above a very square and manly-looking chin, it had
      the air of being ludicrously out of place. &ldquo;Umph,&rdquo; said his
      old aunt, Mrs. Massey (who had just died and left him what she possessed),
      on the occasion of her first introduction to him five-and-thirty years
      before, &ldquo;Umph! Nature meant to make a pretty girl of you, and
      changed her mind after she had finished the mouth. Well, never mind,
      better be a plain man than a pretty woman. There, go along, boy! I like
      your ugly face.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was the old lady peculiar in this respect, for plain as the
      countenance of Colonel Harold Quaritch undoubtedly was, people found
      something very taking about it, when once they became accustomed to its
      rugged air and stern regulated expression. What that something was it
      would be hard to define, but perhaps the nearest approach to the truth
      would be to describe it as a light of purity which, notwithstanding the
      popular idea to the contrary, is quite as often to be found upon the faces
      of men as upon those of women. Any person of discernment looking on
      Colonel Quaritch must have felt that he was in the presence of a good man&mdash;not
      a prig or a milksop, but a man who had attained by virtue of thought and
      struggle that had left their marks upon him, a man whom it would not be
      well to tamper with, one to be respected by all, and feared of evildoers.
      Men felt this, and he was popular among those who knew him in his service,
      though not in any hail-fellow-well-met kind of way. But among women he was
      not popular. As a rule they both feared and disliked him. His presence
      jarred upon the frivolity of the lighter members of their sex, who dimly
      realised that his nature was antagonistic, and the more solid ones could
      not understand him. Perhaps this was the reason why Colonel Quaritch had
      never married, had never even had a love affair since he was
      five-and-twenty.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet it was of a woman that he was thinking as he leant over the gate,
      and looked at the field of yellowing corn, undulating like a golden sea
      beneath the pressure of the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Quaritch had twice before been at Honham, once ten, and once four
      years ago. Now he was come to abide there for good. His old aunt, Mrs.
      Massey, had owned a place in the village&mdash;a very small place&mdash;called
      Honham Cottage, or Molehill, and on those two occasions he visited her.
      Mrs. Massey was dead and buried. She had left him the property, and with
      some reluctance, he had given up his profession, in which he saw no
      further prospects, and come to live upon it. This was his first evening in
      the place, for he had arrived by the last train on the previous night. All
      day he had been busy trying to get the house a little straight, and now,
      thoroughly tired, he was refreshing himself by leaning over a gate. It is,
      though a great many people will not believe it, one of the most delightful
      and certainly one of the cheapest refreshments in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then it was, as he leant over the gate, that the image of a woman&rsquo;s
      face rose before his mind as it had continually risen during the last five
      years. Five years had gone since he saw it, and those five years he spent
      in India and Egypt, that is with the exception of six months which he
      passed in hospital&mdash;the upshot of an Arab spear thrust in the thigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had risen before him in all sorts of places and at all sorts of times;
      in his sleep, in his waking moments, at mess, out shooting, and even once
      in the hot rush of battle. He remembered it well&mdash;it was at El Teb.
      It happened that stern necessity forced him to shoot a man with his
      pistol. The bullet cut through his enemy, and with a few convulsions he
      died. He watched him die, he could not help doing so, there was some
      fascination in following the act of his own hand to its dreadful
      conclusion, and indeed conclusion and commencement were very near
      together. The terror of the sight, the terror of what in defence of his
      own life he was forced to do, revolted him even in the heat of the fight,
      and even then, over that ghastly and distorted face, another face spread
      itself like a mask, blotting it out from view&mdash;that woman&rsquo;s
      face. And now again it re-arose, inspiring him with the rather recondite
      reflections as to the immutability of things and impressions with which
      this domestic record opens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five years is a good stretch in a man&rsquo;s journey through the world.
      Many things happen to us in that time. If a thoughtful person were to set
      to work to record all the impressions which impinge upon his mind during
      that period, he would fill a library with volumes, the mere tale of its
      events would furnish a shelf. And yet how small they are to look back
      upon. It seemed but the other day that he was leaning over this very gate,
      and had turned to see a young girl dressed in black, who, with a spray of
      honeysuckle thrust in her girdle, and carrying a stick in her hand, was
      walking leisurely down the lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something about the girl&rsquo;s air that had struck him while
      she was yet a long way off&mdash;a dignity, a grace, and a set of the
      shoulders. Then as she came nearer he saw the soft dark eyes and the
      waving brown hair that contrasted so strangely and effectively with the
      pale and striking features. It was not a beautiful face, for the mouth was
      too large, and the nose was not as straight as it might have been, but
      there was a power about the broad brow, and a force and solid nobility
      stamped upon the features which had impressed him strangely. Just as she
      came opposite to where he was standing, a gust of wind, for there was a
      stiff breeze, blew the lady&rsquo;s hat off, taking it over the hedge, and
      he, as in duty bound, scrambled into the field and fetched it for her, and
      she had thanked him with a quick smile and a lighting up of the brown
      eyes, and then passed on with a bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, with a little bow she had passed on, and he watched her walking down
      the long level drift, till her image melted into the stormy sunset light,
      and was gone. When he returned to the cottage he had described her to his
      old aunt, and asked who she might be, to learn that she was Ida de la
      Molle (which sounded like a name out of a novel), the only daughter of the
      old squire who lived at Honham Castle. Next day he had left for India, and
      saw Miss de la Molle no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now he wondered what had become of her. Probably she was married; so
      striking a person would be almost sure to attract the notice of men. And
      after all what could it matter to him? He was not a marrying man, and
      women as a class had little attraction for him; indeed he disliked them.
      It has been said that he had never married, and never even had a love
      affair since he was five-and-twenty. But though he was not married, he
      once&mdash;before he was five-and-twenty&mdash;very nearly took that step.
      It was twenty years ago now, and nobody quite knew the history, for in
      twenty years many things are fortunately forgotten. But there was a
      history, and a scandal, and the marriage was broken off almost on the day
      it should have taken place. And after that it leaked out in the
      neighbourhood that the young lady, who by the way was a considerable
      heiress, had gone off her head, presumably with grief, and been confined
      in an asylum, where she was believed still to remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was the thought of this one woman&rsquo;s face, the woman he
      had once seen walking down the drift, her figure limned out against the
      stormy sky, that led him to think of the other face, the face hidden in
      the madhouse. At any rate, with a sigh, or rather a groan, he swung
      himself round from the gate and began to walk homeward at a brisk pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drift that he was following is known as the mile drift, and had in
      ancient times formed the approach to the gates of Honham Castle, the seat
      of the ancient and honourable family of de la Molle (sometimes written
      &ldquo;Delamol&rdquo; in history and old writings). Honham Castle was now
      nothing but a ruin, with a manor house built out of the wreck on one side
      of its square, and the broad way that led to it from the high road which
      ran from Boisingham,[*] the local country town, was a drift or grass lane.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [*] Said to have been so named after the Boissey family,
     whose heiress a de la Molle married in the fourteenth
     century. As, however, the town of Boisingham is mentioned by
     one of the old chroniclers, this does not seem very
     probable. No doubt the family took their name from the town
     or hamlet, not the town from the family.
</pre>
    <p>
      Colonel Quaritch followed this drift till he came to the high road, and
      then turned. A few minutes&rsquo; walk brought him to a drive opening out
      of the main road on the left as he faced towards Boisingham. This drive,
      which was some three hundred yards long, led up a rather sharp slope to
      his own place, Honham Cottage, or Molehill, as the villagers called it, a
      title calculated to give a keen impression of a neat spick and span red
      brick villa with a slate roof. In fact, however, it was nothing of the
      sort, being a building of the fifteenth century, as a glance at its
      massive flint walls was sufficient to show. In ancient times there had
      been a large Abbey at Boisingham, two miles away, which, the records tell,
      suffered terribly from an outbreak of the plague in the fifteenth century.
      After this the monks obtained ten acres of land, known as Molehill, by
      grant from the de la Molle of the day, and so named either on account of
      their resemblance to a molehill (of which more presently) or after the
      family. On this elevated spot, which was supposed to be peculiarly
      healthy, they built the little house now called Honham Cottage, whereto to
      fly when next the plague should visit them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as they built it, so, with some slight additions, it had remained to
      this day, for in those ages men did not skimp their flint, and oak, and
      mortar. It was a beautiful little spot, situated upon the flat top of a
      swelling hill, which comprised the ten acres of grazing ground originally
      granted, and was, strange to say, still the most magnificently-timbered
      piece of ground in the country side. For on the ten acres of grass land
      there stood over fifty great oaks, some of them pollards of the most
      enormous antiquity, and others which had, no doubt, originally grown very
      close together, fine upstanding trees with a wonderful length and girth of
      bole. This place, Colonel Quaritch&rsquo;s aunt, old Mrs. Massey, had
      bought nearly thirty years before when she became a widow, and now,
      together with a modest income of two hundred a year, it had passed to him
      under her will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shaking himself clear of his sad thoughts, Harold Quaritch turned round at
      his own front door to contemplate the scene. The long, single-storied
      house stood, it has been said, at the top of the rising land, and to the
      south and west and east commanded as beautiful a view as is to be seen in
      the county. There, a mile or so away to the south, situated in the midst
      of grassy grazing grounds, and flanked on either side by still perfect
      towers, frowned the massive gateway of the old Norman castle. Then, to the
      west, almost at the foot of Molehill, the ground broke away in a deep bank
      clothed with timber, which led the eye down by slow descents into the
      beautiful valley of the Ell. Here the silver river wound its gentle way
      through lush and poplar-bordered marshes, where the cattle stand knee-deep
      in flowers; past quaint wooden mill-houses, through Boisingham Old Common,
      windy looking even now, and brightened here and there with a dash of
      golden gorse, till it was lost beneath the picturesque cluster of
      red-tiled roofs that marked the ancient town. Look which way he would, the
      view was lovely, and equal to any to be found in the Eastern counties,
      where the scenery is fine enough in its own way, whatever people may
      choose to say to the contrary, whose imaginations are so weak that they
      require a mountain and a torrent to excite them into activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind the house to the north there was no view, and for a good reason,
      for here in the very middle of the back garden rose a mound of large size
      and curious shape, which completely shut out the landscape. What this
      mound, which may perhaps have covered half an acre of ground, was, nobody
      had any idea. Some learned folk write it down a Saxon tumulus, a
      presumption to which its ancient name, &ldquo;Dead Man&rsquo;s Mount,&rdquo;
      seemed to give colour. Other folk, however, yet more learned, declared it
      to be an ancient British dwelling, and pointed triumphantly to a hollow at
      the top, wherein the ancient Britishers were supposed to have moved,
      lived, and had their being&mdash;which must, urged the opposing party,
      have been a very damp one. Thereon the late Mrs. Massey, who was a British
      dwellingite, proceeded to show with much triumph <i>how</i> they had lived
      in the hole by building a huge mushroom-shaped roof over it, and thereby
      turning it into a summer-house, which, owing to unexpected difficulties in
      the construction of the roof, cost a great deal of money. But as the roof
      was slated, and as it was found necessary to pave the hollow with tiles
      and cut surface drains in it, the result did not clearly prove its use as
      a dwelling place before the Roman conquest. Nor did it make a very good
      summer house. Indeed it now served as a store place for the gardener&rsquo;s
      tools and for rubbish generally.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. &mdash; THE COLONEL MEETS THE SQUIRE
    </h2>
    <p>
      As Colonel Quaritch was contemplating these various views and reflecting
      that on the whole he had done well to come and live at Honham Cottage, he
      was suddenly startled by a loud voice saluting him from about twenty yards
      distance with such peculiar vigour that he fairly jumped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel Quaritch, I believe,&rdquo; said, or rather shouted, the
      voice from somewhere down the drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the Colonel mildly, &ldquo;here I am.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I thought it was you. Always tell a military man, you know.
      Excuse me, but I am resting for a minute, this last pull is an uncommonly
      stiff one. I always used to tell my dear old friend, Mrs. Massey, that she
      ought to have the hill cut away a bit just here. Well, here goes for it,&rdquo;
      and after a few heavy steps his visitor emerged from the shadow of the
      trees into the sunset light which was playing on the terrace before the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Quaritch glanced up curiously to see who the owner of the great
      voice might be, and his eyes lit upon as fine a specimen of humanity as he
      had seen for a long while. The man was old, as his white hair showed,
      seventy perhaps, but that was the only sign of decay about him. He was a
      splendid man, broad and thick and strong, with a keen, quick eye, and a
      face sharply chiselled, and clean shaved, of the stamp which in novels is
      generally known as aristocratic, a face, in fact, that showed both birth
      and breeding. Indeed, as clothed in loose tweed garments and a gigantic
      pair of top boots, his visitor stood leaning on his long stick and resting
      himself after facing the hill, Harold Quaritch thought that he had never
      seen a more perfect specimen of the typical English country gentleman&mdash;as
      the English country gentleman used to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, sir, how do you do&mdash;my name is de la Molle. My
      man George, who knows everybody&rsquo;s business except his own, told me
      that you had arrived here, so I thought I would walk round and do myself
      the honour of making your acquaintance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very kind of you,&rdquo; said the Colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. If you only knew how uncommonly dull it is down in
      these parts you would not say that. The place isn&rsquo;t what it used to
      be when I was a boy. There are plenty of rich people about, but they are
      not the same stamp of people. It isn&rsquo;t what it used to be in more
      ways than one,&rdquo; and the old Squire gave something like a sigh, and
      thoughtfully removed his white hat, out of which a dinner napkin and two
      pocket-handkerchiefs fell to the ground, in a fashion that reminded
      Colonel Quaritch of the climax of a conjuring trick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have dropped some&mdash;some linen,&rdquo; he said, stooping
      down to pick the mysterious articles up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, thank you,&rdquo; answered his visitor, &ldquo;I find the
      sun a little hot at this time of the year. There is nothing like a few
      handkerchiefs or a towel to keep it off,&rdquo; and he rolled the mass of
      napery into a ball, and cramming it back into the crown, replaced the hat
      on his head in such a fashion that about eight inches of white napkin hung
      down behind. &ldquo;You must have felt it in Egypt,&rdquo; he went on
      &mdash;&ldquo;the sun I mean. It&rsquo;s a bad climate, that Egypt, as I
      have good reason to know,&rdquo; and he pointed again to his white hat,
      which Harold Quaritch now observed for the first time was encircled by a
      broad black band.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I suppose that you have had a
      loss.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, a very heavy loss.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Colonel Quaritch had never heard that Mr. de la Molle had more than
      one child, Ida de la Molle, the young lady whose face remained so strongly
      fixed in his memory, although he had scarcely spoken to her on that one
      occasion five long years ago. Could it be possible that she had died in
      Egypt? The idea sent a tremor of fear through him, though of course there
      was no real reason why it should. Deaths are so common.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not&mdash;not Miss de la Molle?&rdquo; he said nervously, adding,
      &ldquo;I had the pleasure of seeing her once, a good many years ago, when
      I was stopping here for a few days with my aunt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, not Ida, she is alive and well, thank God. Her brother
      James. He went all through that wretched war which we owe to Mr.
      Gladstone, as I say, though I don&rsquo;t know what your politics are, and
      then caught a fever, or as I think got touched by the sun, and died on his
      way home. Poor boy! He was a fine fellow, Colonel Quaritch, and my only
      son, but very reckless. Only a month or so before he died, I wrote to him
      to be careful always to put a towel in his helmet, and he answered, in
      that flippant sort of way he had, that he was not going to turn himself
      into a dirty clothes bag, and that he rather liked the heat than
      otherwise. Well, he&rsquo;s gone, poor fellow, in the service of his
      country, like many of his ancestors before him, and there&rsquo;s an end
      of him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And again the old man sighed, heavily this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Colonel Quaritch,&rdquo; he went on, shaking off his
      oppression with a curious rapidity that was characteristic of him, &ldquo;what
      do you say to coming up to the Castle for your dinner? You must be in a
      mess here, and I expect that old Mrs. Jobson, whom my man George tells me
      you have got to look after you, will be glad enough to be rid of you for
      to-night. What do you say?&mdash;take the place as you find it, you know.
      I believe that there is a leg of mutton for dinner if there is nothing
      else, because instead of minding his own business I saw George going off
      to Boisingham to fetch it this morning. At least, that is what he said he
      was going for; just an excuse to gossip and idle, I fancy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, really,&rdquo; said the Colonel, &ldquo;you are very kind;
      but I don&rsquo;t think that my dress clothes are unpacked yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dress clothes! Oh, never mind your dress clothes. Ida will excuse
      you, I daresay. Besides, you have no time to dress. By Jove, it&rsquo;s
      nearly seven o&rsquo;clock; we must be off if you are coming.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel hesitated. He had intended to dine at home, and being a
      methodical-minded man did not like altering his plans. Also, he was, like
      most military men, very punctilious about his dress and personal
      appearance, and objected to going out to dinner in a shooting coat. But
      all this notwithstanding, a feeling that he did not quite understand, and
      which it would have puzzled even an American novelist to analyse&mdash;something
      between restlessness and curiosity, with a dash of magnetic attraction
      thrown in&mdash;got the better of his scruples, and he accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, thank you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you are sure that Miss
      de la Molle will not mind, I will come. Just allow me to tell Mrs. Jobson.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; halloaed the Squire after him, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      meet you at the back of the house. We had better go through the fields.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time that the Colonel, having informed his housekeeper that he
      should not want any dinner, and hastily brushed his not too luxuriant
      locks, had reached the garden which lay behind the house, the Squire was
      nowhere to be seen. Presently, however, a loud halloa from the top of the
      tumulus-like hill announced his whereabouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wondering what the old gentleman could be doing there, Harold Quaritch
      walked up the steps that led to the summit of the mound, and found him
      standing at the entrance to the mushroom-shaped summer-house,
      contemplating the view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Colonel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a perfect view
      for you. Talk about Scotland and the Alps! Give me a view of the valley of
      Ell from the top of Dead Man&rsquo;s Mount on an autumn evening, and I
      never want to see anything finer. I have always loved it from a boy, and
      always shall so long as I live&mdash;look at those oaks, too. There are no
      such trees in the county that I know of. The old lady, your aunt, was
      wonderfully fond of them. I hope&mdash;&rdquo; he went on in a tone of
      anxiety&mdash;&ldquo;I hope that you don&rsquo;t mean to cut any of them
      down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; said the Colonel, &ldquo;I should never think of such
      a thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Never cut down a good tree if you can help it.
      I&rsquo;m sorry to say, however,&rdquo; he added after a pause, &ldquo;that
      I have been forced to cut down a good many myself. Queer place this, isn&rsquo;t
      it?&rdquo; he continued, dropping the subject of the trees, which was
      evidently a painful one to him. &ldquo;Dead Man&rsquo;s Mount is what the
      people about here call it, and that is what they called it at the time of
      the Conquest, as I can prove to you from ancient writings. I always
      believed that it was a tumulus, but of late years a lot of these clever
      people have been taking their oath that it is an ancient British dwelling,
      as though Ancient Britons, or any one else for that matter, could live in
      a kind of drainhole. But they got on the soft side of your old aunt&mdash;who,
      by the way, begging your pardon, was a wonderfully obstinate old lady when
      once she hammered an idea into her head&mdash;and so she set to work and
      built this slate mushroom over the place, and one way and another it cost
      her two hundred and fifty pounds. Dear me! I shall never forget her face
      when she saw the bill,&rdquo; and the old gentleman burst out into a
      Titanic laugh, such as Harold Quaritch had not heard for many a long day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;it is a queer spot. I think that I
      must have a dig at it one day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove,&rdquo; said the Squire, &ldquo;I never thought of that. It
      would be worth doing. Hulloa, it is twenty minutes past seven, and we dine
      at half past. I shall catch it from Ida. Come on, Colonel Quaritch; you
      don&rsquo;t know what it is to have a daughter&mdash;a daughter when one
      is late for dinner is a serious thing for any man,&rdquo; and he started
      off down the hill in a hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very soon, however, he seemed to forget the terrors in store, and strolled
      along, stopping now and again to admire some particular oak or view;
      chatting all the while in a discursive manner, which, though somewhat
      aimless, was by no means without its charm. He made a capital companion
      for a silent man like Harold Quaritch who liked to hear other people talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way they went down the slope, and crossing a couple of wheat
      fields came to a succession of broad meadows, somewhat sparsely timbered.
      Through these the footpath ran right up to the grim gateway of the ancient
      Castle, which now loomed before them, outlined in red lines of fire
      against the ruddy background of the sunset sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, it&rsquo;s a fine old place, Colonel, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
      said the Squire, catching the exclamation of admiration that broke from
      his companion&rsquo;s lips, as a sudden turn brought them into line with
      the Norman ruin. &ldquo;History&mdash;that&rsquo;s what it is; history in
      stone and mortar; this is historic ground, every inch of it. Those old de
      la Molles, my ancestors, and the Boisseys before them, were great folk in
      their day, and they kept up their position well. I will take you to see
      their tombs in the church yonder on Sunday. I always hoped to be buried
      beside them, but I can&rsquo;t manage it now, because of the Act. However,
      I mean to get as near to them as I can. I have a fancy for the
      companionship of those old Barons, though I expect that they were a
      roughish lot in their lifetimes. Look how squarely those towers stand out
      against the sky. They always remind me of the men who built them&mdash;sturdy,
      overbearing fellows, setting their shoulders against the sea of
      circumstance and caring neither for man nor devil till the priests got
      hold of them at the last. Well, God rest them, they helped to make
      England, whatever their faults. Queer place to choose for a castle,
      though, wasn&rsquo;t it? right out in an open plain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that they trusted to their moat and walls, and the hagger
      at the bottom of the dry ditch,&rdquo; said the Colonel. &ldquo;You see
      there is no eminence from which they could be commanded, and their archers
      could sweep all the plain from the battlements.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, of course they could. It is easy to see that you are a
      soldier. They were no fools, those old crusaders. My word, we must be
      getting on. They are hauling down the Union Jack on the west tower. I
      always have it hauled down at sunset,&rdquo; and he began walking briskly
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another three minutes they had crossed a narrow by-road, and were
      passing up the ancient drive that led to the Castle gates. It was not much
      of a drive, but there were still some half-dozen of old pollard oaks that
      had no doubt stood there before the Norman Boissey, from whose family,
      centuries ago, the de la Molles had obtained the property by marriage with
      the heiress, had got his charter and cut the first sod of his moat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right before them was the gateway of the Castle, flanked by two great
      towers, and these, with the exception of some ruins were, as a matter of
      fact, all that remained of the ancient building, which had been
      effectually demolished in the time of Cromwell. The space within, where
      the keep had once stood, was now laid out as a flower garden, while the
      house, which was of an unpretentious nature, and built in the Jacobean
      style, occupied the south side of the square, and was placed with its back
      to the moat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see I have practically rebuilt those two towers,&rdquo; said
      the Squire, pausing underneath the Norman archway. &ldquo;If I had not
      done it,&rdquo; he added apologetically, &ldquo;they would have been in
      ruins by now, but it cost a pretty penny, I can tell you. Nobody knows
      what stuff that old flint masonry is to deal with, till he tries it. Well,
      they will stand now for many a long day. And here we are&rdquo;&mdash;and
      he pushed open a porch door and then passed up some steps and through a
      passage into an oak-panelled vestibule, which was hung with tapestry
      originally taken, no doubt, from the old Castle, and decorated with coats
      of armour, spear heads, and ancient swords.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here it was that Harold Quaritch once more beheld the face which had
      haunted his memory for so many months.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. &mdash; THE TALE OF SIR JAMES DE LA MOLLE
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, father?&rdquo; said a voice, a very sweet voice, but
      one of which the tones betrayed the irritation natural to a healthy woman
      who has been kept waiting for her dinner. The voice came from the recesses
      of the dusky room in which the evening gloom had gathered deeply, and
      looking in its direction, Harold Quaritch could see the outline of a tall
      form sitting in an old oak chair with its hands crossed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, father? Really it is too bad to be so late for dinner&mdash;especially
      after you blew up that wretched Emma last night because she was five
      minutes after time. I have been waiting so long that I have almost been
      asleep.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry, my dear, very,&rdquo; said the old gentleman
      apologetically, &ldquo;but&mdash;hullo! I&rsquo;ve knocked my head&mdash;here,
      Mary, bring me a light!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a light,&rdquo; said the voice, and at the same moment
      there was a sound of a match being struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another moment the candle was burning, and the owner of the voice had
      turned, holding it in such a fashion that its rays surrounded her like an
      aureole&mdash;showing Harold Quaritch that face of which the memory had
      never left him. There were the same powerful broad brow, the same nobility
      of look, the same brown eyes and soft waving hair. But the girlhood had
      gone out of them, the face was now the face of a woman who knew what life
      meant, and had not found it too easy. It had lost some of its dreaminess,
      he thought, though it had gained in intellectual force. As for the figure,
      it was much more admirable than the face, which was strictly speaking not
      a beautiful one. The figure, however, was undoubtedly beautiful, indeed,
      it is doubtful if many women could show a finer. Ida de la Molle was a
      large, strong woman, and there was about her a swing and a lissom grace
      which is very rare, and as attractive as it is rare. She was now nearly
      six-and-twenty years of age, and not having begun to wither in accordance
      with the fate which overtakes all unmarried women after thirty, was at her
      very best. Harold Quaritch, glancing at her well-poised head, her perfect
      neck and arms (for she was in evening dress) and her gracious form,
      thought to himself that he had never seen a nobler-looking woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, my dear father,&rdquo; she went on as she watched the candle
      burn up, &ldquo;you made such a fuss this morning about the dinner being
      punctually at half-past seven, and now it is eight o&rsquo;clock and you
      are not dressed. It is enough to ruin any cook,&rdquo; and she broke off
      for the first time, seeing that her father was not alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear, yes,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, &ldquo;I dare say
      I did. It is human to err, my dear, especially about dinner on a fine
      evening. Besides, I have made amends and brought you a visitor, our new
      neighbour, Colonel Quaritch. Colonel Quaritch, let me introduce you to my
      daughter, Miss de la Molle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that we have met before,&rdquo; said Harold, in a somewhat
      nervous fashion, as he stretched out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Ida, taking it, &ldquo;I remember. It was in
      the long drift, five years ago, on a windy afternoon, when my hat blew
      over the hedge and you went to fetch it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a good memory, Miss de la Molle,&rdquo; said he, feeling
      not a little pleased that she should have recollected the incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evidently not better than your own, Colonel Quaritch,&rdquo; was
      the ready answer. &ldquo;Besides, one sees so few strangers here that one
      naturally remembers them. It is a place where nothing happens&mdash;time
      passes, that is all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the old Squire, who had been making a prodigious fuss with his
      hat and stick, which he managed to send clattering down the flight of
      stone steps, departed to get ready, saying in a kind of roar as he went
      that Ida was to order in the dinner, as he would be down in a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly she rang the bell, and told the maid to bring in the soup in
      five minutes and to lay another place. Then turning to Harold she began to
      apologise to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what sort of dinner you will get, Colonel
      Quaritch,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it is so provoking of my father; he
      never gives one the least warning when he is going to ask any one to
      dinner.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all&mdash;not at all,&rdquo; he answered hurriedly. &ldquo;It
      is I who ought to apologise, coming down on you like&mdash;like&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A wolf on the fold,&rdquo; suggested Ida.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, exactly,&rdquo; he went on earnestly, looking at his coat,
      &ldquo;but not in purple and gold.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she went on laughing, &ldquo;you will get very little
      to eat for your pains, and I know that soldiers always like good dinners.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that, Miss de la Molle?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, because of poor James and his friends whom he used to bring
      here. By the way, Colonel Quaritch,&rdquo; she went on with a sudden
      softening of the voice, &ldquo;you have been in Egypt, I know, because I
      have so often seen your name in the papers; did you ever meet my brother
      there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew him slightly,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Only very slightly.
      I did not know that he was your brother, or indeed that you had a brother.
      He was a dashing officer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      What he did not say, however, was that he also knew him to have been one
      of the wildest and most extravagant young men in an extravagant regiment,
      and as such had to some extent shunned his society on the few occasions
      that he had been thrown in with him. Perhaps Ida, with a woman&rsquo;s
      quickness, divined from his tone that there was something behind his
      remark&mdash;at any rate she did not ask him for particulars of their
      slight acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was my only brother,&rdquo; she continued; &ldquo;there never
      were but we two, and of course his loss was a great blow to me. My father
      cannot get over it at all, although&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and she broke off
      suddenly, and rested her head upon her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the Squire was heard advancing down the stairs, shouting to
      the servants as he came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand pardons, my dear, a thousand pardons,&rdquo; he said as
      he entered the room, &ldquo;but, well, if you will forgive particulars, I
      was quite unable to discover the whereabouts of a certain necessary
      portion of the male attire. Now, Colonel Quaritch, will you take my
      daughter? Stop, you don&rsquo;t know the way&mdash;perhaps I had better
      show you with the candle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly he advanced out of the vestibule, and turning to the left, led
      the way down a long passage till he reached the dining-room. This
      apartment was like the vestibule, oak-panelled, but the walls were
      decorated with family and other portraits, including a very curious
      painting of the Castle itself, as it was before its destruction in the
      time of Cromwell. This painting was executed on a massive slab of oak, and
      conceived in a most quaint and formal style, being relieved in the
      foreground with stags at gaze and woodeny horses, that must, according to
      any rule of proportion, have been about half as large as the gateway
      towers. Evidently, also, it was of an older date than the present house,
      which is Jacobean, having probably been removed to its present position
      from the ruins of the Castle. Such as it was, however, it gave a very good
      idea of what the ancient seat of the Boisseys and de la Molles had been
      like before the Roundheads had made an end of its glory. The dining-room
      itself was commodious, though not large. It was lighted by three narrow
      windows which looked out upon the moat, and bore a considerable air of
      solid comfort. The table, made of black oak, of extraordinary solidity and
      weight, was matched by a sideboard of the same material and apparently of
      the same date, both pieces of furniture being, as Mr. de la Molle informed
      his guests, relics of the Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this sideboard were placed several pieces of old and massive plate,
      each of which was rudely engraved with three falcons <i>or</i>, the arms
      of the de la Molle family. One piece, indeed, a very ancient salver, bore
      those of the Boisseys&mdash;a ragged oak, in an escutcheon of pretence&mdash;showing
      thereby that it dated from that de la Molle who in the time of Henry the
      Seventh had obtained the property by marriage with the Boissey heiress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conversation having turned that way, as the dinner, which was a simple
      one, went on, the old Squire had this piece of plate brought to Harold
      Quaritch for him to examine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very curious,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;have you much of this,
      Mr. de la Molle?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No indeed,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I wish I had. It all vanished in
      the time of Charles the First.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Melted down, I suppose,&rdquo; said the Colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that is the odd part of it. I don&rsquo;t think it was. It was
      hidden somewhere&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know where, or perhaps it was turned
      into money and the money hidden. But I will tell you the story if you like
      as soon as we have done dinner.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, when the servants had removed the cloth, and after the old
      fashion placed the wine upon the naked wood, the Squire began his tale, of
      which the following is the substance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the time of James I. the de la Molle family was at the height of
      its prosperity, that is, so far as money goes. For several generations
      previous the representatives of the family had withdrawn themselves from
      any active participation in public affairs, and living here at small
      expense upon their lands, which were at that time very large, had amassed
      a quantity of wealth that, for the age, might fairly be called enormous.
      Thus, Sir Stephen de la Molle, the grandfather of the Sir James who lived
      in the time of James I., left to his son, also named Stephen, a sum of no
      less than twenty-three thousand pounds in gold. This Stephen was a great
      miser, and tradition says that he trebled the sum in his lifetime. Anyhow,
      he died rich as Croesus, and abominated alike by his tenants and by the
      country side, as might be expected when a gentleman of his race and fame
      degraded himself, as this Sir Stephen undoubtedly did, to the practice of
      usury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the next heir, Sir James, however, the old spirit of the de la
      Molles seems to have revived, although it is sufficiently clear that he
      was by no means a spendthrift, but on the contrary, a careful man, though
      one who maintained his station and refused to soil his fingers with such
      base dealing as it had pleased his uncle to do. Going to court, he became,
      perhaps on account of his wealth, a considerable favourite with James I.,
      to whom he was greatly attached and from whom he bought a baronetcy.
      Indeed, the best proof of his devotion is, that he on two occasions lent
      large sums of money to the King which were never repaid. On the accession
      of Charles I., however, Sir James left court under circumstances which
      were never quite cleared up. It is said that smarting under some slight
      which was put upon him, he made a somewhat brusque demand for the money
      that he had lent to James. Thereon the King, with sarcastic wit,
      congratulated him on the fact that the spirit of his uncle, Sir Stephen de
      la Molle, whose name was still a byword in the land, evidently survived in
      the family. Sir James turned white with anger, bowed, and without a word
      left the court, nor did he ever return thither.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Years passed, and the civil war was at its height. Sir James had as
      yet steadily refused to take any share in it. He had never forgiven the
      insult put upon him by the King, for like most of his race, of whom it was
      said that they never forgave an injury and never forgot a kindness, he was
      a pertinacious man. Therefore he would not lift a finger in the King&rsquo;s
      cause. But still less would he help the Roundheads, whom he hated with a
      singular hatred. So time went, till at last, when he was sore pressed,
      Charles, knowing his great wealth and influence, brought himself to write
      a letter to this Sir James, appealing to him for support, and especially
      for money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I hear,&rsquo; said the King in his letter, &lsquo;that Sir
      James de la Molle, who was aforetyme well affected to our person and more
      especially to the late King, our sainted father, doth stand idle, watching
      the growing of this bloody struggle and lifting no hand. Such was not the
      way of the race from which he sprang, which, unless history doth greatly
      lie, hath in the past been ever found at the side of their kings striking
      for the right. It is told to me also, that Sir James de la Molle doth thus
      place himself aside blowing neither hot nor cold, because of some sharp
      words which we spake in heedless jest many a year that&rsquo;s gone. We
      know not if this be true, doubting if a man&rsquo;s memory be so long, but
      if so it be, then hereby do we crave his pardon, and no more can we do.
      And now is our estate one of grievous peril, and sorely do we need the aid
      of God and man. Therefore, if the heart of our subject Sir James de la
      Molle be not rebellious against us, as we cannot readily credit it to be,
      we do implore his present aid in men and money, of which last it is said
      he hath large store, this letter being proof of our urgent need.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These were, as nearly as I can remember, the very words of the
      letter, which was written with the King&rsquo;s own hand, and show pretty
      clearly how hardly he was pressed. It is said that when he read it, Sir
      James, forgetting his grievance, was much affected, and, taking paper,
      wrote hastily as follows, which indeed he certainly did, for I have seen
      the letter in the Museum. &lsquo;My liege,&mdash;Of the past I will not
      speak. It is past. But since it hath graciously pleased your Majesty to
      ask mine aid against the rebels who would overthrow your throne, rest
      assured that all I have is at your Majesty&rsquo;s command, till such time
      as your enemies are discomfited. It hath pleased Providence to so prosper
      my fortunes that I have stored away in a safe place, till these times be
      past, a very great sum in gold, whereof I will at once place ten thousand
      pieces at the disposal of your Majesty, so soon as a safe means can be
      provided of conveying the same, seeing that I had sooner die than that
      these great moneys should fall into the hands of rebels to the furtherance
      of a wicked cause.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the letter went on to say that the writer would at once buckle
      to and raise a troop of horse among his tenantry, and that if other
      satisfactory arrangements could not be made for the conveyance of the
      moneys, he would bring them in person to the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now comes the climax of the story. The messenger was captured
      and Sir James&rsquo;s incautious letter taken from his boot, as a result
      of which within ten days&rsquo; time he found himself closely besieged by
      five hundred Roundheads under the command of one Colonel Playfair. The
      Castle was but ill-provisioned for a siege, and in the end Sir James was
      driven by sheer starvation to surrender. No sooner had he obtained an
      entry, then Colonel Playfair sent for his prisoner, and to his
      astonishment produced to Sir James&rsquo;s face his own letter to the
      King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Now, Sir James,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;we have the hive, and
      I must ask you to lead us to the honey. Where be those great moneys
      whereof you talk herein? Fain would I be fingering these ten thousand
      pieces of gold, the which you have so snugly stored away.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; answered old Sir James, &lsquo;you have the hive,
      but the secret of the honey you have not, nor shall you have it. The ten
      thousand pieces in gold is where it is, and with it is much more. Find it
      if you may, Colonel, and take it if you can.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I shall find it by to-morrow&rsquo;s light, Sir James, or
      otherwise&mdash;or otherwise you die.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I must die&mdash;all men do, Colonel, but if I die, the
      secret dies with me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;This shall we see,&rsquo; answered the Colonel grimly, and
      old Sir James was marched off to a cell, and there closely confined on
      bread and water. But he did not die the next day, nor the next, nor for a
      week, indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every day he was brought up before the Colonel, and under the
      threat of immediate death questioned as to where the treasure was, not
      being suffered meanwhile to communicate by word or sign with any one, save
      the officers of the rebels. Every day he refused, till at last his
      inquisitor&rsquo;s patience gave out, and he was told frankly that if he
      did not communicate the secret he would be shot at the following dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Sir James laughed, and said that shoot him they might, but that
      he consigned his soul to the Devil if he would enrich them with his
      treasures, and then asked that his Bible might be brought to him that he
      might read therein and prepare himself for death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They gave him the Bible and left him. Next morning at the dawn, a
      file of Roundheads marched him into the courtyard of the Castle and here
      he found Colonel Playfair and his officers waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Now, Sir James, for your last word,&rsquo; said the
      Roundhead. &lsquo;Will you reveal where the treasure lies, or will you
      choose to die?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I will not reveal,&rsquo; answered the old man. &lsquo;Murder
      me if ye will. The deed is worthy of Holy Presbyters. I have spoken and my
      mind is fixed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Bethink you,&rsquo; said the Colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I have thought,&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;and I am ready.
      Slay me and seek the treasure. But one thing I ask. My young son is not
      here. In France hath he been these three years, and nought knows he of
      where I have hid this gold. Send to him this Bible when I am dead. Nay,
      search it from page to page. There is nought therein save what I have writ
      here upon this last sheet. It is all I have left to give.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The book shall be searched,&rsquo; answered the Colonel,
      &lsquo;and if nought is found therein it shall be sent. And now, in the
      name of God, I adjure you, Sir James, let not the love of lucre stand
      between you and your life. Here I make you one last offer. Discover but to
      us the ten thousand pounds whereof you speak in this writing,&rsquo; and
      he held up the letter to the King, &lsquo;and you shall go free&mdash;refuse
      and you die.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I refuse,&rsquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Musqueteers, make ready,&rsquo; shouted the Colonel, and the
      file of men stepped forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But at that moment there came up so furious a squall of wind, and
      with it such dense and cutting rain, that for a while the execution was
      delayed. Presently it passed, the wild light of the November morning swept
      out from the sky, and revealed the doomed man kneeling in prayer upon the
      sodden turf, the water running from his white hair and beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They called to him to stand up, but he would not, and continued
      praying. So they shot him on his knees.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Colonel Quaritch, &ldquo;at any rate he died like
      a gallant gentleman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment there was a knock at the door, and the servant came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked the Squire.

    <p>
      &ldquo;George is here, please, sir,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;and says
      that he would like to see you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound him,&rdquo; growled the old gentleman; &ldquo;he is always
      here after something or other. I suppose it is about the Moat Farm. He was
      going to see Janter to-day. Will you excuse me, Quaritch? My daughter will
      tell you the end of the story if you care to hear any more. I will join
      you in the drawing-room.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. &mdash; THE END OF THE TALE
    </h2>
    <p>
      As soon as her father had gone, Ida rose and suggested that if Colonel
      Quaritch had done his wine they should go into the drawing-room, which
      they accordingly did. This room was much more modern than either the
      vestibule or the dining-room, and had an air and flavour of nineteenth
      century young lady about it. There were the little tables, the draperies,
      the photograph frames, and all the hundred and one knick-knacks and odds
      and ends by means of which a lady of taste makes a chamber lovely in the
      eyes of brutal man. It was a very pleasant place to look upon, this
      drawing-room at Honham Castle, with its irregular recesses, its somewhat
      faded colours illuminated by the soft light of a shaded lamp, and its
      general air of feminine dominion. Harold Quaritch was a man who had seen
      much of the world, but who had not seen very much of drawing-rooms, or,
      indeed, of ladies at large. They had not come in his way, or if they did
      come in his way he had avoided them. Therefore, perhaps, he was the more
      susceptible to such influences when he was brought within their reach. Or
      perchance it was Ida&rsquo;s gracious presence which threw a charm upon
      the place that added to its natural attractiveness, as the china bowls of
      lavender and rose leaves added perfume to the air. Anyhow, it struck him
      that he had rarely before seen a room which conveyed to his mind such
      strong suggestions of refinement and gentle rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a charming room,&rdquo; he said, as he entered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you think so,&rdquo; answered Ida; &ldquo;because it is
      my own territory, and I arrange it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is easy to see that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, would you like to hear the end of the story about Sir James
      and his treasure?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; it interests me very much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It positively <i>fascinates</i> me,&rdquo; said Ida with emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, and I will tell you. After they had shot old Sir James they
      took the Bible off him, but whether or no Colonel Playfair ever sent it to
      the son in France, is not clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The story is all known historically, and it is certain that, as my
      father said, he asked that his Bible might be sent, but nothing more. This
      son, Sir Edward, never lived to return to England. After his father&rsquo;s
      murder, the estates were seized by the Parliamentary party, and the old
      Castle, with the exception of the gate towers, razed to the ground, partly
      for military purposes and partly in the long and determined attempt that
      was made to discover old Sir James&rsquo;s treasure, which might, it was
      thought, have been concealed in some secret chamber in the walls. But it
      was all of no use, and Colonel Playfair found that in letting his temper
      get the better of him and shooting Sir James, he had done away with the
      only chance of finding it that he was ever likely to have, for to all
      appearance the secret had died with its owner. There was a great deal of
      noise about it at the time, and the Colonel was degraded from his rank in
      reward for what he had done. It was presumed that old Sir James must have
      had accomplices in the hiding of so great a mass of gold, and every means
      was taken, by way of threats and promises of reward&mdash;which at last
      grew to half of the total amount that should be discovered&mdash;to induce
      these to come forward if they existed, but without result. And so the
      matter went on, till after a few years the quest died away and was
      forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meanwhile the son, Sir Edward, who was the second and last baronet,
      led a wandering life abroad, fearing or not caring to return to England
      now that all his property had been seized. When he was two-and-twenty
      years of age, however, he contracted an imprudent marriage with his
      cousin, a lady of the name of Ida Dofferleigh, a girl of good blood and
      great beauty, but without means. Indeed, she was the sister of Geoffrey
      Dofferleigh, who was a first cousin and companion in exile of Sir Edward&rsquo;s,
      and as you will presently see, my lineal ancestor. Well, within a year of
      this marriage, poor Ida, my namesake, died with her baby of fever, chiefly
      brought on, they say, by want and anxiety of mind, and the shock seems to
      have turned her husband&rsquo;s brain. At any rate, within three or four
      months of her death, he committed suicide. But before he did so, he
      formally executed a rather elaborate will, by which he left all his
      estates in England, &lsquo;now unjustly withheld from me contrary to the
      law and natural right by the rebel pretender Cromwell, together with the
      treasure hidden thereon or elsewhere by my late murdered father, Sir James
      de la Molle,&rsquo; to John Geoffrey Dofferleigh, his cousin, and the
      brother of his late wife, and his heirs for ever, on condition only of his
      assuming the name and arms of the de la Molle family, the direct line of
      which became extinct with himself. Of course, this will, when it was
      executed, was to all appearance so much waste paper, but within three
      years from that date Charles II. was King of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thereon Geoffrey Dofferleigh produced the document, and on assuming
      the name and arms of de la Molle actually succeeded in obtaining the
      remains of the Castle and a considerable portion of the landed property,
      though the baronetcy became extinct. His son it was who built this present
      house, and he is our direct ancestor, for though my father talks of them
      as though they were&mdash;it is a little weakness of his&mdash;the old de
      la Molles are not our direct male ancestors.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Harold, &ldquo;and did Dofferleigh find the
      treasure?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ah, no, nor anybody else; the treasure has vanished. He hunted
      for it a great deal, and he did find those pieces of plate which you saw
      to-night, hidden away somewhere, I don&rsquo;t know where, but there was
      nothing else with them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps the whole thing was nonsense,&rdquo; said Harold
      reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Ida shaking her head, &ldquo;I am sure it was
      not, I am sure the treasure is hidden away somewhere to this day. Listen,
      Colonel Quaritch&mdash;you have not heard quite all the story yet&mdash;<i>I</i>
      found something.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute and I will show you,&rdquo; and going to a cabinet in
      the corner, she unlocked it, and took out a despatch box, which she also
      unlocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I found this. It is the Bible that
      Sir James begged might be sent to his son, just before they shot him, you
      remember,&rdquo; and she handed him a small brown book. He took it and
      examined it carefully. It was bound in leather, and on the cover was
      written in large letters, &ldquo;Sir James de la Molle. Honham Castle,
      1611.&rdquo; Nor was this all. The first sheets of the Bible, which was
      one of the earliest copies of the authorised version, were torn out, and
      the top corner was also gone, having to all appearance been shot off by a
      bullet, a presumption that a dark stain of blood upon the cover and edges
      brought near to certainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor gentleman,&rdquo; said Harold, &ldquo;he must have had it in
      his pocket when he was shot. Where did you find it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I suppose so,&rdquo; said Ida, &ldquo;in fact I have no doubt
      of it. I found it when I was a child in an ancient oak chest in the
      basement of the western tower, quite hidden up in dusty rubbish and bits
      of old iron. But look at the end and you will see what he wrote in it to
      his son, Edward. Here, I will show you,&rdquo; and leaning over him she
      turned to the last page of the book. Between the bottom of the page and
      the conclusion of the final chapter of Revelations there had been a small
      blank space now densely covered with crabbed writing in faded ink, which
      she read aloud. It ran as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Do not grieve for me, Edward, my son, that I am thus suddenly
      done to death by rebel murderers, for nought happeneth but according to
      God&rsquo;s will. And now farewell, Edward, till we shall meet in heaven.
      My monies have I hid and on account thereof I die unto this world, knowing
      that not one piece shall Cromwell touch. To whom God shall appoint, shall
      all my treasure be, for nought can I communicate.</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Ida triumphantly, &ldquo;what do you think of
      that, Colonel Quaritch? The Bible, I think, was never sent to his son, but
      here it is, and in that writing, as I solemnly believe,&rdquo; and she
      laid her white finger upon the faded characters, &ldquo;lies the key to
      wherever it is that the money is hidden, only I fear I shall never make it
      out. For years I have puzzled over it, thinking that it might be some form
      of acrostic, but I can make nothing of it. I have tried it all ways. I
      have translated it into French, and had it translated into Latin, but
      still I can find out nothing&mdash;nothing. But some day somebody will hit
      upon it&mdash;at least I hope so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold shook his head. &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that
      what has remained undiscovered for so long will remain so till the end of
      the chapter. Perhaps old Sir James was hoaxing his enemies!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ida, &ldquo;for if he was, what became of all the
      money? He was known to be one of the richest men of his day, and that he
      was rich we can see from his letter to the King. There was nothing found
      after his death, except his lands, of course. Oh, it will be found
      someday, twenty centuries hence, probably, much too late to be of any good
      to us,&rdquo; and she sighed deeply, while a pained and wearied expression
      spread itself over her handsome face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Harold in a doubtful voice, &ldquo;there may be
      something in it. May I take a copy of that writing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Ida laughing, &ldquo;and if you find the
      treasure we will go shares. Stop, I will dictate it to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as this process was finished and Harold was shutting up his
      pocket-book, in which he put the fair copy he had executed on a half-sheet
      of note paper, the old Squire came into the room again. Looking at his
      face, his visitor saw that the interview with &ldquo;George&rdquo; had
      evidently been anything but satisfactory, for it bore an expression of
      exceedingly low spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, father, what is the matter?&rdquo; asked his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing, my dear, nothing,&rdquo; he answered in melancholy
      tones. &ldquo;George has been here, that is all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and I wish he would keep away,&rdquo; she said with a little
      stamp of her foot, &ldquo;for he always brings some bad news or other.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the times, my dear, it is the times; it isn&rsquo;t George. I
      really don&rsquo;t know what has come to the country.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Ida with a deepening expression of anxiety.
      &ldquo;Something wrong with the Moat Farm?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; Janter has thrown it up after all, and I am sure I don&rsquo;t
      know where I am to find another tenant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see what the pleasures of landed property are, Colonel
      Quaritch,&rdquo; said Ida, turning towards him with a smile which did not
      convey a great sense of cheerfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I know. Thank goodness I have only the
      ten acres that my dear old aunt left to me. And now,&rdquo; he added,
      &ldquo;I think that I must be saying good-night. It is half-past ten, and
      I expect that old Mrs. Jobson is sitting up for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida looked up in remonstrance, and opened her lips to speak, and then for
      some reason that did not appear changed her mind and held out her hand.
      &ldquo;Good-night, Colonel Quaritch,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I am so
      pleased that we are going to have you as a neighbour. By-the-way, I have a
      few people coming to play lawn tennis here to-morrow afternoon, will you
      come too?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What,&rdquo; broke in the Squire, in a voice of irritation, &ldquo;more
      lawn tennis parties, Ida? I think that you might have spared me for once&mdash;with
      all this business on my hands, too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, father,&rdquo; said his daughter, with some acerbity.
      &ldquo;How can a few people playing lawn tennis hurt you? It is quite
      useless to shut oneself up and be miserable over things that one cannot
      help.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman collapsed with an air of pious resignation, and meekly
      asked who was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nobody in particular. Mr. and Mrs. Jeffries&mdash;Mr. Jeffries
      is our clergyman, you know, Colonel Quaritch&mdash;and Dr. Bass and the
      two Miss Smiths, one of whom he is supposed to be in love with, and Mr.
      and Mrs. Quest, and Mr. Edward Cossey, and a few more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Edward Cossey,&rdquo; said the Squire, jumping off his chair;
      &ldquo;really, Ida, you know I detest that young man, that I consider him
      an abominable young man; and I think you might have shown more
      consideration to me than to have asked him here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not help it, father,&rdquo; she answered coolly. &ldquo;He
      was with Mrs. Quest when I asked her, so I had to ask him too. Besides, I
      rather like Mr. Cossey, he is always so polite, and I don&rsquo;t see why
      you should take such a violent prejudice against him. Anyhow, he is
      coming, and there is an end of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cossey, Cossey,&rdquo; said Harold, throwing himself into the
      breach, &ldquo;I used to know that name.&rdquo; It seemed to Ida that he
      winced a little as he said it. &ldquo;Is he one of the great banking
      family?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ida, &ldquo;he is one of the sons. They say he
      will have half a million of money or more when his father, who is very
      infirm, dies. He is looking after the branch banks of his house in this
      part of the world, at least nominally. I fancy that Mr. Quest really
      manages them; certainly he manages the Boisingham branch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said the Squire, &ldquo;if they are coming, I
      suppose they are coming. At any rate, I can go out. If you are going home,
      Quaritch, I will walk with you. I want a little air.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel Quaritch, you have not said if you will come to my party
      to-morrow, yet,&rdquo; said Ida, as he stretched out his hand to say
      good-bye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you, Miss de la Molle; yes, I think I can come, though I
      play tennis atrociously.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we all do that. Well, good-night. I am so very pleased that you
      have come to live at Molehill; it will be so nice for my father to have a
      companion,&rdquo; she added as an afterthought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Colonel grimly, &ldquo;we are almost of an age&mdash;good-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida watched the door close and then leant her arm on the mantelpiece, and
      reflected that she liked Colonel Quaritch very much, so much that even his
      not very beautiful physiognomy did not repel her, indeed rather attracted
      her than otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;I think that is the
      sort of man I should like to marry. Nonsense,&rdquo; she added, with an
      impatient shrug, &ldquo;nonsense, you are nearly six-and-twenty,
      altogether too old for that sort of thing. And now there is this new
      trouble about the Moat Farm. My poor old father! Well, it is a hard world,
      and I think that sleep is about the best thing in it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And with a sigh she lighted her candle to go to bed, then changed her mind
      and sat down to await her father&rsquo;s return.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. &mdash; THE SQUIRE EXPLAINS THE POSITION
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what is coming to this country, I really don&rsquo;t;
      and that&rsquo;s a fact,&rdquo; said the Squire to his companion, after
      they had walked some paces in silence. &ldquo;Here is the farm, the Moat
      Farm. It fetched twenty-five shillings an acre when I was a young man, and
      eight years ago it used to fetch thirty-five. Now I have reduced it and
      reduced it to fifteen, just in order to keep the tenant. And what is the
      end of it? Janter&mdash;he&rsquo;s the tenant&mdash;gave notice last
      Michaelmas; but that stupid owl, George, said it was all nothing, and that
      he would continue at fifteen shillings when the time came. And now
      to-night he comes to me with a face as long as a yard-arm, and says that
      Janter won&rsquo;t keep it at any price, and that he does not know where
      he is to find another tenant, not he. It&rsquo;s quite heartbreaking, that&rsquo;s
      what it is. Three hundred acres of good, sound, food-producing land, and
      no tenant for it at fifteen shillings an acre. What am I to do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you take it in hand and farm it yourself?&rdquo; asked
      Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I take it in hand? I have one farm of a hundred and fifty
      acres in hand as it is. Do you know what it would cost to take over that
      farm?&rdquo; and he stopped in his walk and struck his stick into the
      ground. &ldquo;Ten pounds an acre, every farthing of it&mdash;and say a
      thousand for the covenants&mdash;about four thousand pounds in all. Now
      where am I to get four thousand pounds to speculate with in that way, for
      it is a speculation, and one which I am too old to look after myself, even
      if I had the knowledge. Well, there you are, and now I&rsquo;ll say
      good-night, sir. It&rsquo;s getting chilly, and I have felt my chest for
      the last year or two. By-the-way, I suppose I shall see you to-morrow at
      this tennis party of Ida&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s all very well for Ida to go
      in for her tennis parties, but how can I think of such things with all
      this worry on my hands? Well, good-night, Colonel Quaritch, good-night,&rdquo;
      and he turned and walked away through the moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold Quaritch watched him go and then stalked off home, reflecting, not
      without sadness, upon the drama which was opening up before him, that most
      common of dramas in these days of depression,&mdash;the break up of an
      ancient family through causes beyond control. It required far less acumen
      and knowledge of the world than he possessed to make it clear to him that
      the old race of de la Molle was doomed. This story of farms thrown up and
      money not forthcoming pointed its own moral, and a sad one it was. Even
      Ida&rsquo;s almost childish excitement about the legend of the buried
      treasure showed him how present to her mind must be the necessity of
      money; and he fell to thinking how pleasant it would be to be able to play
      the part of the Fairy Prince and step in with untold wealth between her
      and the ruin which threatened her family. How well that grand-looking
      open-minded Squire would become a great station, fitted as he was by
      nature, descent, and tradition, to play the solid part of an English
      country gentleman of the good old-fashioned kind. It was pitiful to think
      of a man of his stamp forced by the vile exigencies of a narrow purse to
      scheme and fight against the advancing tide of destitution. And Ida, too,&mdash;Ida,
      who was equipped with every attribute that can make wealth and power what
      they should be&mdash;a frame to show off her worth and state. Well, it was
      the way of the world, and he could not mend it; but it was with a bitter
      sense of the unfitness of things that with some little difficulty&mdash;for
      he was not yet fully accustomed to its twists and turns&mdash;he found his
      way past the swelling heap of Dead Man&rsquo;s Mount and round the house
      to his own front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered the house, and having told Mrs. Jobson that she could go to
      bed, sat down to smoke and think. Harold Quaritch, like many solitary men,
      was a great smoker, and never did he feel the need for the consolation of
      tobacco more than on this night. A few months ago, when he had retired
      from the army, he found himself in a great dilemma. There he was, a hale,
      active man of three-and-forty, of busy habits, and regular mind, suddenly
      thrown upon the world without occupation. What was he to do with himself?
      While he was asking this question and waiting blankly for an answer which
      did not come, his aunt, old Mrs. Massey, departed this life, leaving him
      heir to what she possessed, which might be three hundred a year in all.
      This, added to his pension and the little that he owned independently, put
      him beyond the necessity of seeking further employment. So he had made up
      his mind to come to reside at Molehill, and live the quiet, somewhat
      aimless, life of a small country gentleman. His reading, for he was a
      great reader, especially of scientific works, would, he thought, keep him
      employed. Moreover, he was a thorough sportsman, and an ardent, though
      owing to the smallness of his means, necessarily not a very extensive,
      collector of curiosities, and more particularly of coins.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, after he had come to his decision, a feeling of infinite rest
      and satisfaction had taken possession of him. The struggle of life was
      over for him. No longer would he be obliged to think, and contrive, and
      toil; henceforth his days would slope gently down towards the inevitable
      end. Trouble lay in the past, now rest and rest alone awaited him, rest
      that would gradually grow deeper and deeper as the swift years rolled by,
      till it was swallowed up in that almighty Peace to which, being a simple
      and religious man, he had looked forward from childhood as the end and
      object of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foolish man and vain imagining! Here, while we draw breath, there is no
      rest. We must go on continually, on from strength to strength, or weakness
      to weakness; we must always be troubled about this or that, and must ever
      have this desire or that to regret. It is an inevitable law within whose
      attraction all must fall; yes, even the purest souls, cradled in their
      hope of heaven; and the most swinish, wallowing in the mud of their
      gratified desires.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so our hero had already begun to find out. Here, before he had been
      forty-eight hours in Honham, a fresh cause of troubles had arisen. He had
      seen Ida de la Molle again, and after an interval of between five and six
      years had found her face yet more charming than it was before. In short he
      had fallen in love with it, and being a sensible man he did not conceal
      this fact from himself. Indeed the truth was that he had been in love with
      her for all these years, though he had never looked at the matter in that
      light. At the least the pile had been gathered and laid, and did but
      require a touch of the match to burn up merrily enough. And now this was
      supplied, and at the first glance of Ida&rsquo;s eyes the magic flame
      began to hiss and crackle, and he knew that nothing short of a convulsion
      or a deluge would put it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men of the stamp of Harold Quaritch generally pass through three stages
      with reference to the other sex. They begin in their youth by making a
      goddess of one of them, and finding out their mistake. Then for many years
      they look upon woman as the essence and incarnation of evil and a thing no
      more to be trusted than a jaguar. Ultimately, however, this folly wears
      itself out, probably in proportion as the old affection fades and dies
      away, and is replaced by contempt and regret that so much should have been
      wasted on that which was of so little worth. Then it is that the danger
      comes, for then a man puts forth his second venture, puts it forth with
      fear and trembling, and with no great hope of seeing a golden Argosy
      sailing into port. And if it sinks or is driven back by adverse winds and
      frowning skies, there is an end of his legitimate dealings with such frail
      merchandise.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now he, Harold Quaritch, was about to put forth this second venture,
      not of his own desire or free will indeed, but because his reason and
      judgment were over-mastered. In short, he had fallen in love with Ida de
      la Molle when he first saw her five years ago, and was now in the process
      of discovering the fact. There he sat in his chair in the old
      half-furnished room, which he proposed to turn into his dining-room, and
      groaned in spirit over this portentous discovery. What had become of his
      fair prospect of quiet years sloping gently downwards, and warm with the
      sweet drowsy light of afternoon? How was it that he had not known those
      things that belonged to his peace? And probably it would end in nothing.
      Was it likely that such a splendid young woman as Ida would care for a
      superannuated army officer, with nothing to recommend him beyond five or
      six hundred a year and a Victoria Cross, which he never wore. Probably if
      she married at all she would try to marry someone who would assist to
      retrieve the fallen fortunes of her family, which it was absolutely beyond
      his power to do. Altogether the outlook did not please him, as he sat
      there far into the watches of the night, and pulled at his empty pipe. So
      little did it please him, indeed, that when at last he rose to find his
      way to bed up the old oak staircase, the only imposing thing in Molehill,
      he had almost made up his mind to give up the idea of living at Honham at
      all. He would sell the place and emigrate to Vancouver&rsquo;s Island or
      New Zealand, and thus place an impassable barrier between himself and that
      sweet, strong face, which seemed to have acquired a touch of sternness
      since last he looked upon it five years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, wise resolutions of the quiet night, whither do you go in the garish
      light of day? To heaven, perhaps, with the mist wreaths and the dew drops.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Squire got back to the castle, he found his daughter still
      sitting in the drawing room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, not gone to bed, Ida?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, father, I was going, and then I thought that I would wait to
      hear what all this is about Janter and the Moat Farm. It is best to get it
      over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, my dear&mdash;yes, but there is not much to tell you.
      Janter has thrown up the farm after all, and George says that there is not
      another tenant to be had for love or money. He tried one man, who said
      that he would not have it at five shillings an acre, as prices are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is bad enough in all conscience,&rdquo; said Ida, pushing at
      the fireirons with her foot. &ldquo;What is to be done?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is to be done?&rdquo; answered her father irritably. &ldquo;How
      can I tell you what is to be done? I suppose I must take the place in
      hand, that is all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but that costs money, does it not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it does, it costs about four thousand pounds.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Ida, looking up, &ldquo;and where is all that sum
      to come from? We have not got four thousand pounds in the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come from? Why I suppose that I must borrow it on the security of
      the land.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it not be better to let the place go out of cultivation,
      rather than risk so much money?&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go out of cultivation! Nonsense, Ida, how can you talk like that?
      Why that strong land would be ruined for a generation to come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it would, but surely it would be better that the land
      should be ruined than that we should be. Father, dear,&rdquo; she said
      appealingly, laying one hand upon his shoulder, &ldquo;do be frank with
      me, and tell me what our position really is. I see you wearing yourself
      out about business from day to day, and I know that there is never any
      money for anything, scarcely enough to keep the house going; and yet you
      will not tell me what we really owe&mdash;and I think I have a right to
      know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire turned impatiently. &ldquo;Girls have no head for these things,&rdquo;
      he said, &ldquo;so what is the use of talking about it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am not a girl; I am a woman of six-and-twenty; and putting
      other things aside, I am almost as much interested in your affairs as you
      are yourself,&rdquo; she said with determination. &ldquo;I cannot bear
      this sort of thing any longer. I see that abominable man, Mr. Quest,
      continually hovering about here like a bird of ill-omen, and I cannot bear
      it; and I tell you what it is, father, if you don&rsquo;t tell me the
      whole truth at once I shall cry,&rdquo; and she looked as though she meant
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the old Squire was no more impervious to a woman&rsquo;s tears than
      any other man, and of all Ida&rsquo;s moods, and they were many, he most
      greatly feared that rare one which took the form of tears. Besides, he
      loved his only daughter more dearly than anything in the world except one
      thing, Honham Castle, and could not bear to give her pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of course if you wish to know
      about these things you have a right to. I have desired to spare you
      trouble, that is all; but as you are so very imperious, the best thing
      that I can do is to let you have your own way. Still, as it is rather
      late, if you have no objection I think that I had better put if off till
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, father. By to-morrow you will have changed your mind. Let
      us have it now. I want to know how much we really owe, and what we have
      got to live on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman hummed and hawed a little, and after various indications
      of impatience at last began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as you know, our family has for some generations depended
      upon the land. Your dear mother brought a small fortune with her, five or
      six thousand pounds, but that, with the sanction of her trustees, was
      expended upon improvements to the farms and in paying off a small
      mortgage. Well, for many years the land brought in about two thousand a
      year, but somehow we always found it difficult to keep within that income.
      For instance, it was necessary to repair the gateway, and you have no idea
      of the expense in which those repairs landed me. Then your poor brother
      James cost a lot of money, and always would have the shooting kept up in
      such an extravagant way. Then he went into the army, and heaven only knows
      what he spent there. Your brother was very extravagant, my dear, and well,
      perhaps I was foolish; I never could say him no. And that was not all of
      it, for when the poor boy died he left fifteen hundred pounds of debt
      behind him, and I had to find the money, if it was only for the honour of
      the family. Of course you know that we cut the entail when he came of age.
      Well, and then these dreadful times have come upon the top of it all, and
      upon my word, at the present moment I don&rsquo;t know which way to turn,&rdquo;
      and he paused and drummed his fingers uneasily upon a book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father, but you have not told me yet what it is that we owe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is difficult to answer that all in a minute. Perhaps
      twenty-five thousand on mortgage, and a few floating debts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is the place worth?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It used to be worth between fifty and sixty thousand pounds. It is
      impossible to say what it would fetch now. Land is practically a drug in
      the market. But things will come round, my dear. It is only a question of
      holding on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then if you borrow a fresh sum in order to take up this farm, you
      will owe about thirty thousand pounds, and if you give five per cent., as
      I suppose you do, you will have to pay fifteen hundred a year in interest.
      Now, father, you said that in the good times the land brought in two
      thousand a year, so, of course, it can&rsquo;t bring in so much now.
      Therefore, by the time that you have paid the interest, there will be
      nothing, or less than nothing, left for us to live on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father winced at this cruel and convincing logic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is not so bad as that. You jump
      to conclusions, but really, if you do not mind, I am very tired, and
      should like to go to bed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, what is the use of trying to shirk the thing just because
      it is disagreeable?&rdquo; she asked earnestly. &ldquo;Do you suppose that
      it is more pleasant to me to talk about it than it is for you? I know that
      you are not to blame about it. I know that dear James was very thoughtless
      and extravagant, and that the times are crushing. But to go on like this
      is only to go to ruin. It would be better for us to live in a cottage on a
      couple of hundred a year than to try to keep our heads above water here,
      which we cannot do. Sooner or later these people, Quest, or whoever they
      are, will want their money back, and then, if they cannot have it, they
      will sell the place over our heads. I believe that man Quest wants to get
      it himself&mdash;that is what I believe &mdash;and set up as a country
      gentleman. Father, I know it is a dreadful thing to say, but we ought to
      leave Honham.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave Honham!&rdquo; said the old gentleman, jumping up in his
      agitation; &ldquo;what nonsense you talk, Ida. How can I leave Honham? It
      would kill me at my age. How can I do it? And, besides, who is to look
      after the farms and all the business? No, no, we must hang on and trust to
      Providence. Things may come round, something may happen, one can never
      tell in this world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we do not leave Honham, then Honham will leave us,&rdquo;
      answered his daughter, with conviction. &ldquo;I do not believe in
      chances. Chances always go the wrong way&mdash;against those who are
      looking for them. We shall be absolutely ruined, that is all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps you are right, perhaps you are right, my dear,&rdquo;
      said the old Squire wearily. &ldquo;I only hope that my time may come
      first. I have lived here all my life, seventy years and more, and I know
      that I could not live anywhere else. But God&rsquo;s will be done. And
      now, my dear, go to bed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She leant down and kissed him, and as she did so saw that his eyes were
      filled with tears. Not trusting herself to speak, for she felt for him too
      deeply to do so, she turned away and went, leaving the old man sitting
      there with his grey head bowed upon his breast.

      CHAPTER VI. &mdash; LAWYER QUEST
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day following that of the conversation just described was one of those
      glorious autumn mornings which sometimes come as a faint compensation for
      the utter vileness and bitter disappointment of the season that in this
      country we dignify by the name of summer. Notwithstanding his vigils and
      melancholy of the night before, the Squire was up early, and Ida, who
      between one thing and another had not had the best of nights, heard his
      loud cheery voice shouting about the place for &ldquo;George.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking out of her bedroom window, she soon perceived that functionary
      himself, a long, lean, powerful-looking man with a melancholy face and a
      twinkle in his little grey eyes, hanging about the front steps. Presently
      her father emerged in a brilliant but ancient dressing gown, his white
      locks waving on the breeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, George, where are you, George?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I be, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes; then why didn&rsquo;t you say so? I have been shouting
      myself hoarse for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yis, Squire,&rdquo; replied the imperturbable George, &ldquo;I hev
      been a-standing here for the last ten minutes, and I heard you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You heard me, then why the dickens didn&rsquo;t you answer?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I didn&rsquo;t think as you wanted me, sir. I saw that you
      hadn&rsquo;t finished your letter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, you ought to. You know very well that my chest is weak,
      and yet I have to go hallooing all over the place after you. Now look
      here, have you got that fat pony of yours in the yard?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yis, Squire, the pony is here, and if so be as it is fat it bean&rsquo;t
      for the want of movement.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then, take this letter,&rdquo; and he handed him an
      epistle sealed with a tremendous seal, &ldquo;take this letter to Mr.
      Quest at Boisingham, and wait for an answer. And look here, mind you are
      about the place at eleven o&rsquo;clock, for I expect Mr. Quest to see me
      about the Moat Farm.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yis, Squire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that you have heard nothing more from Janter, have you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Squire, nawthing. He means to git the place at his own price or
      chuck it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is his price?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five shillings an acre. You see, sir, it&rsquo;s this way. That
      army gent, Major Boston, as is agent for all the College lands down the
      valley, he be a poor weak fule, and when all these tinants come to him and
      say that they must either hev the land at five shillings an acre or go, he
      gits scared, he du, and down goes the rent of some of the best meadow land
      in the country from thirty-five shillings to five. Of course it don&rsquo;t
      signify to him not a halfpenny, the College must pay him his salary all
      the same, and he don&rsquo;t know no more about farming, nor land, nor
      northing, than my old mare yinder. Well, and what comes of it? Of course
      every tinant on the place hears that those College lands be going for five
      shillings an acre, and they prick up their ears and say they must have
      their land at the same figger, and it&rsquo;s all owing to that Boston
      varmint, who ought to be kicked through every holl on the place and then
      drowned to dead in a dyke.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re right there, George, that silly man is a public
      enemy, and ought to be treated as such, but the times are very bad, with
      corn down to twenty-nine, very bad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a-saying that they ain&rsquo;t bad, Squire,&rdquo;
      said his retainer, his long face lighting up; &ldquo;they are bad, cruel
      bad, bad for iverybody. And I&rsquo;m not denying that they is bad for the
      tinants, but if they is bad for the tinants they is wus for the landlord.
      It all comes on his shoulders in the long run. If men find they can get
      land at five shillings an acre that&rsquo;s worth twenty, why it isn&rsquo;t
      in human natur to pay twenty, and if they find that the landlord must go
      as they drive him, of course they&rsquo;ll lay on the whip. Why, bless
      you, sir, when a tinant comes and says that he is very sorry but he finds
      he can&rsquo;t pay his rent, in nine cases out of ten, you&rsquo;d find
      that the bank was paid, the tradesmen were paid, the doctor&rsquo;s paid,
      iverybody&rsquo;s paid before he thinks about his rent. Let the landlord
      suffer, because he can&rsquo;t help hisself; but Lord bless us, if a
      hundred pounds were overdue to the bank it would have the innards out of
      him in no time, and he knows it. Now as for that varmint, Janter, to tell
      me that he can&rsquo;t pay fifteen shillings an acre for the Moat Farm, is
      nonsense. I only wish I had the capital to take it at the price, that I
      du.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, George,&rdquo; said the Squire, &ldquo;I think that if it can
      be managed I shall borrow the money and take the farm on hand. I am not
      going to let Janter have it at five shillings an acre.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, sir, that&rsquo;s the best way. Bad as times be, it will go
      hard if I can&rsquo;t make the interest and the rent out of it too.
      Besides, Squire, if you give way about this here farm, all the others will
      come down on you. I&rsquo;m not saying a word agin your tinants, but where
      there&rsquo;s money to be made you can&rsquo;t trust not no man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said the Squire, &ldquo;perhaps you are right
      and perhaps you ain&rsquo;t. Right or wrong, you always talk like Solomon
      in all his glory. Anyway, be off with that note and let me have the answer
      as soon as you get back. Mind you don&rsquo;t go loafing and jawing about
      down in Boisingham, because I want my answer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he means to borrow the money if he can get it,&rdquo; said Ida
      to herself as she sat, an invisible auditor, doing her hair by the open
      window. &ldquo;George can do more with him in five minutes than I can do
      in a week, and I know that he hates Janter. I believe Janter threw up the
      farm because of his quarrelling with George. Well, I suppose we must take
      our chance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile George had mounted his cart and departed upon the road to
      Boisingham, urging his fat pony along as though he meant to be there in
      twenty minutes. But so soon as he was well out of reach of the Squire&rsquo;s
      shouts and sight of the Castle gates, he deliberately turned up a bye lane
      and jogged along for a mile or more to a farm, where he had a long
      confabulation with a man about thatching some ricks. Thence he quietly
      made his way to his own little place, where he proceeded to comfortably
      get his breakfast, remarking to his wife that he was of opinion that there
      was no hurry about the Squire&rsquo;s letter, as the &ldquo;lawyers&rdquo;
      wasn&rsquo;t in the habit of coming to office at eight in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast over, the philosophic George got into his cart, the fat pony
      having been tied up outside, and leisurely drove into the picturesque old
      town which lay at the head of the valley. All along the main street he met
      many acquaintances, and with each he found it necessary to stop and have a
      talk, indeed with two he had a modest half-pint. At length, however, his
      labour o&rsquo;er, he arrived at Mr. Quest&rsquo;s office, that, as all
      the Boisingham world knows, was just opposite the church, of which Mr.
      Quest was one of the churchwardens, and which but two years before was
      beautifully restored, mainly owing to his efforts and generous
      contributions. Driving up to the small and quiet-looking doorway of a very
      unpretentious building, George descended and knocked. Thereon a clerk
      opened the door, and in answer to his inquiries informed him that he
      believed Mr. Quest had just come over to the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another minute he was shown into an inner room of the ordinary country
      lawyer&rsquo;s office stamp, and there at the table sat Mr. Quest himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Quest was a man of about forty years of age, rather under than over,
      with a pale ascetic cast of face, and a quiet and pleasant, though
      somewhat reserved, manner. His features were in no way remarkable, with
      the exception of his eyes, which seemed to have been set in his head owing
      to some curious error of nature. For whereas his general tone was dark,
      his hair in particular being jet black, these eyes were grey, and jarred
      extraordinarily upon their companion features. For the rest, he was a man
      of some presence, and with the manners of a gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, George,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what is it that brings you to
      Boisingham? A letter from the Squire. Thank you. Take a seat, will you,
      will I look through it? Umph, wants me to come and see him at eleven o&rsquo;clock.
      I am very sorry, but I can&rsquo;t manage that anyway. Ah, I see, about
      the Moat Farm. Janter told me that he was going to throw it up, and I
      advised him to do nothing of the sort, but he is a dissatisfied sort of a
      fellow, Janter is, and Major Boston has upset the whole country side by
      his very ill-advised action about the College lands.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Janter is a warmint and Major Boston, begging his pardon for the
      language, is an ass, sir. Anyway there it is, Janter has thrown up, and
      where I am to find a tinant between now and Michaelmas I don&rsquo;t know;
      in fact, with the College lands going at five shillings an acre there ain&rsquo;t
      no chance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what does the Squire propose to do&mdash;take the land in
      hand?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, that&rsquo;s it; and that&rsquo;s what he wants to see
      you about.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More money, I suppose,&rdquo; said Mr. Quest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yis, sir. You see there will be covenants to meet, and then
      the farm is three hundred acres, and to stock it proper as it should be
      means nine pounds an acre quite, on this here heavy land.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I know, a matter of four thousand more or less, but where
      is it to come from, that&rsquo;s the question? Cossey&rsquo;s do not like
      land now, any more than other banks do. However, I&rsquo;ll see my
      principal about it. But, George, I can&rsquo;t possibly get up to the
      Castle at eleven. I have got a churchwardens&rsquo; meeting at a quarter
      to, about that west pinnacle, you know. It is in a most dangerous
      condition, and by-the-way, before you go I should like to have your
      opinion, as a practical man, as to the best way to deal with it. To
      rebuild it would cost a hundred and twenty pounds, and that is more than
      we see our way to at present, though I can promise fifty if they can scape
      up the rest. But about the Squire. I think that the best thing I can do
      will be to come up to the Castle to lunch, and then I can talk over
      matters with him. Stay, I will just write him a note. By-the-way, you
      would like a glass of wine, wouldn&rsquo;t you, George? Nonsense man, here
      it is in the cupboard, a glass of wine is a good friend to have handy
      sometimes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      George, who like most men of his stamp could put away his share of liquor
      and feel thankful for it, drank his glass of wine while Mr. Quest was
      engaged in writing the note, wondering meanwhile what made the lawyer so
      civil to him. For George did not like Mr. Quest. Indeed, it would not be
      too much to say that he hated him. But this was a feeling which he never
      allowed to appear; he was too much afraid of the man for that, and in his
      queer way too much devoted to the old Squire&rsquo;s interests to run the
      risk of imperilling them by the exhibition of any aversion to Mr. Quest.
      He knew more of his master&rsquo;s affairs than anybody living, unless,
      perhaps, it was Mr. Quest himself, and was aware that the lawyer held the
      old gentleman in a bondage that could not be broken. Now, George was a man
      with faults. He was somewhat sly, and, perhaps within certain lines, at
      times capable of giving the word honesty a liberal interpretation. But
      amongst many others he had one conspicuous virtue: he loved the old Squire
      as a Highlandman loves his chief, and would almost, if not quite, have
      died to serve him. His billet was no easy one, for Mr. de la Molle&rsquo;s
      temper was none of the best at times, and when things went wrong, as they
      pretty frequently did, he was exceedingly apt to visit his wrath on the
      head of the devoted George, saying things to him which he should not have
      said. But his retainer took it all in the day&rsquo;s work, and never bore
      malice, continuing in his own cadging pigheaded sort of way to labour
      early and late to prop up his master&rsquo;s broken fortunes. &ldquo;Lord,
      sir,&rdquo; as he once said to Harold Quaritch when the Colonel condoled
      with him after a violent and unjust onslaught made by the Squire in his
      presence, &ldquo;Lord, sir, that ain&rsquo;t nawthing, that ain&rsquo;t. I
      don&rsquo;t pay no manner of heed to that. Folk du say how as I wor made
      for he, like a safety walve for a traction engine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, had it not been for George&rsquo;s contrivings and
      procrastinations, Honham Castle and its owner would have parted company
      long before.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. &mdash; EDWARD COSSEY, ESQUIRE
    </h2>
    <p>
      After George had drunk his glass of wine and given his opinion as to the
      best way to deal with the dangerous pinnacle on the Boisingham Church, he
      took the note, untied the fat pony, and ambled off to Honham, leaving the
      lawyer alone. As soon as he was gone, Mr. Quest threw himself back in his
      chair&mdash;an old oak one, by-the-way, for he had a very pretty taste in
      old oak and a positive mania for collecting it&mdash;and plunged into a
      brown study.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he leant forward, unlocked the top drawer of his writing table,
      and extracted from it a letter addressed to himself which he had received
      that very morning. It was from the principals of the great banking firm of
      Cossey and Son, and dated from their head office in Mincing lane. This
      letter ran as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Private and confidential.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Sir,&mdash; &ldquo;We have considered your report as to the
      extensive mortgages which we hold upon the Honham Castle estates, and have
      allowed due weight to your arguments as to the advisability of allowing
      Mr. de la Molle time to give things a chance of righting. But we must tell
      you that we can see no prospect of any such solution of the matter, at any
      rate for some years to come. All the information that we are able to
      gather points to a further decrease in the value of the land rather than
      to a recovery. The interest on the mortgages in question is moreover a
      year in arrear, probably owing to the non-receipt of rents by Mr. de la
      Molle. Under these circumstances, much as it grieves us to take action
      against Mr. de la Molle, with whose family we have had dealings for five
      generations, we can see no alternative to foreclosure, and hereby instruct
      you to take the necessary preliminary steps to bring it about in the usual
      manner. We are, presuming that Mr. de la Molle is not in a position to pay
      off the mortgages, quite aware of the risks of a forced sale, and shall
      not be astonished if, in the present unprecedented condition of the land
      market, such a sale should result in a loss, although the sum recoverable
      does not amount to half the valuation of the estates, which was undertaken
      at our instance about twenty years ago on the occasion of the first
      advance. The only alternative, however, would be for us to enter into
      possession of the property or to buy it in. But this would be a course
      totally inconsistent with the usual practice of the bank, and what is
      more, our confidence in the stability of landed property is so utterly
      shattered by our recent experiences, that we cannot burden ourselves by
      such a course, preferring to run the risk of an immediate loss. This,
      however, we hope that the historical character of the property and its
      great natural advantages as a residential estate will avert, or at the
      least minimise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be so good as to advise us by an early post of the steps you take
      in pursuance of these instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are, dear sir, &ldquo;Your obedient servants, &ldquo;Cossey
      &amp; Son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W. Quest, Esq.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P.S.&mdash;We have thought it better to address you direct in this
      matter, but of course you will communicate the contents of this letter to
      Mr. Edward Cossey, and, subject to our instructions, which are final, act
      in consultation with him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Quest to himself, as he folded up the sheet
      of paper, &ldquo;that is about as straight as it can be put. And this is
      the time that the old gentleman chooses to ask for another four thousand.
      He may ask, but the answer will be more than he bargains for.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose from the chair and began to walk up and down the room in evident
      perplexity. &ldquo;If only,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I had twenty-five
      thousand, I would take up the mortgages myself and foreclose at my
      leisure. It would be a good investment at that figure, even as things are,
      and besides, I should like to have that place. Twenty-five thousand, only
      twenty-five thousand, and now when I want it I have not got it. And I
      should have had it if it had not been for that tiger, that devil Edith.
      She has had more than that out of me in the last ten years, and still she
      is threatening and crying for more, more, more. Tiger; yes, that is the
      name for her, her own name, too. She would coin one&rsquo;s vitals into
      money if she could. All Belle&rsquo;s fortune she has had, or nearly all,
      and now she wants another five hundred, and she will have it too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; and he drew a letter from his pocket written in
      a bold, but somewhat uneducated, woman&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Bill,&rdquo; it ran, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been unlucky again and
      dropped a pot. Shall want 500 pounds by the 1st October. No shuffling,
      mind; money down; but I think that you know me too well to play any more
      larx. When can you tear yourself away, and come and give your E&mdash;&mdash;
      a look? Bring some tin when you come, and we will have times.&mdash;Thine,
      The Tiger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Tiger, yes, the Tiger,&rdquo; he gasped, his face working with
      passion and his grey eyes glinting as he tore the epistle to fragments,
      threw them down and stamped on them. &ldquo;Well, be careful that I don&rsquo;t
      one day cut your claws and paint your stripes. By heaven, if ever a man
      felt like murder, I do now. Five hundred more, and I haven&rsquo;t five
      thousand clear in the world. Truly we pay for the follies of our youth! It
      makes me mad to think of those fools Cossey and Son forcing that place
      into the market just now. There&rsquo;s a fortune in it at the price. In
      another year or two I might have recovered myself&mdash;that devil of a
      woman might be dead&mdash;and I have several irons in the fire, some of
      which are sure to turn up trumps. Surely there must be a way out of it
      somehow. There&rsquo;s a way out of everything except Death if only one
      thinks enough, but the thing is to find it,&rdquo; and he stopped in his
      walk opposite to the window that looked upon the street, and put his hand
      to his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he did so he caught sight of the figure of a tall gentleman strolling
      idly towards the office door. For a moment he stared at him blankly, as a
      man does when he is trying to catch the vague clue to a new idea. Then, as
      the figure passed out of his view, he brought his fist down heavily upon
      the sill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edward Cossey, by George!&rdquo; he said aloud. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      the way out of it, if only I can work him, and unless I have made a
      strange mistake, I think I know the road.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A couple of minutes afterwards a tall, shapely young man, of about
      twenty-four or five years of age, came strolling into the office where Mr.
      Quest was sitting, to all appearance hard at work at his correspondence.
      He was dark in complexion and decidedly distinguished-looking in feature,
      with large dark eyes, dark moustachios, and a pale, somewhat
      Spanish-looking skin. Young as the face was, it had, if observed closely,
      a somewhat worn and worried air, such as one would scarcely expect to see
      upon the countenance of a gentleman born to such brilliant fortunes, and
      so well fitted by nature to do them justice, as was Mr. Edward Cossey. For
      it is not every young man with dark eyes and a good figure who is destined
      to be the future head of one of the most wealthy private banks in England,
      and to inherit in due course a sum of money in hard cash variously
      estimated at from half a million to a million sterling. This, however, was
      the prospect in life that opened out before Mr. Edward Cossey, who was now
      supposed by his old and eminently business-like father to be in process of
      acquiring a sound knowledge of the provincial affairs of the house by
      attending to the working of their branch establishments in the Eastern
      counties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Quest?&rdquo; said Edward Cossey, nodding somewhat
      coldly to the lawyer and sitting down. &ldquo;Any business?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes, Mr. Cossey,&rdquo; answered the lawyer, rising
      respectfully, &ldquo;there is some business, some very serious business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Edward indifferently, &ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is this, the house has ordered a foreclosure on the Honham
      Castle estates&mdash;at least it comes to that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing this intelligence Edward Cossey&rsquo;s whole demeanour
      underwent the most startling transformation&mdash;his languor vanished,
      his eye brightened, and his form became instinct with active life and
      beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the deuce,&rdquo; he said, and then paused. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t
      have it,&rdquo; he went on, jumping up, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have it. I am
      not particularly fond of old de la Molle, perhaps because he is not
      particularly fond of me,&rdquo; he added rather drolly, &ldquo;but it
      would be an infernal shame to break up that family and sell the house over
      them. Why they would be ruined! And then there&rsquo;s Ida&mdash;Miss de
      la Molle, I mean&mdash;what would become of her? And the old place too.
      After being in the family for all these centuries I suppose that it would
      be sold to some confounded counter-skipper or some retired thief of a
      lawyer. It must be prevented at any price&mdash;do you hear, Quest?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer winced a little at his chief&rsquo;s contemptuous allusion, and
      then remarked with a smile, &ldquo;I had no idea that you were so
      sentimental, Mr. Cossey, or that you took such a lively interest in Miss
      de la Molle,&rdquo; and he glanced up to observe the effect of his shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward Cossey coloured. &ldquo;I did not mean that I took any particular
      interest in Miss de la Molle,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I was referring to
      the family.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, quite so, though I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know why you
      shouldn&rsquo;t. Miss de la Molle is one of the most charming women that I
      ever met, I think the most charming except my own wife Belle,&rdquo; and
      he again looked up suddenly at Edward Cossey who, for his part, coloured
      for the second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; went on the lawyer, &ldquo;that a man in
      your position has a most splendid opportunity of playing knight errant to
      the lovely damsel in distress. Here is the lady with her aged father about
      to be sold up and turned out of the estates which have belonged to her
      family for generations&mdash;why don&rsquo;t you do the generous and
      graceful thing, like the hero in a novel, and take up the mortgages?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward Cossey did not reject this suggestion with the contempt that might
      have been expected; on the contrary he appeared to be turning the matter
      over in his mind, for he drummed a little tune with his knuckles and
      stared out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the sum?&rdquo; he said presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five-and-twenty thousand, and he wants four more, say thirty
      thousand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where am I going to find thirty thousand pounds to take up a
      bundle of mortgages which will probably never pay a farthing of interest?
      Why, I have not got three thousand that I can come at. Besides,&rdquo; he
      added, recollecting himself, &ldquo;why should I interfere?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think,&rdquo; answered Mr. Quest, ignoring the latter part
      of the question, &ldquo;that with your prospects you would find it
      difficult to get thirty thousand pounds. I know several who would consider
      it an honour to lend the money to a Cossey, if only for the sake of the
      introduction&mdash;that is, of course, provided the security was of a
      legal nature.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see the letter,&rdquo; said Edward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Quest handed him the document conveying the commands of Cossey and
      Son, and he read it through twice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old man means business,&rdquo; he said, as he returned it;
      &ldquo;that letter was written by him, and when he has once made up his
      mind it is useless to try and stir him. Did you say that you were going to
      see the Squire to-day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I did not say so, but as a matter of fact I am. His man, George&mdash;a
      shrewd fellow, by the way, for one of these bumpkins&mdash;came with a
      letter asking me to go up to the Castle, so I shall get round there to
      lunch. It is about this fresh loan that the old gentleman wishes to
      negotiate. Of course I shall be obliged to tell him that instead of giving
      a fresh loan we have orders to serve a notice on him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that just yet,&rdquo; said Edward with decision.
      &ldquo;Write to the house and say that their instructions shall be
      attended to. There is no hurry about the notice, though I don&rsquo;t see
      how I am to help in the matter. Indeed there is no call upon me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Mr. Cossey. And now, by the way, are you going to the
      Castle this afternoon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I believe so. Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I want to get up there to luncheon, and I am in a fix. Mrs.
      Quest will want the trap to go there this afternoon. Can you lend me your
      dogcart to drive up in? and then perhaps you would not mind if she gave
      you a lift this afternoon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; answered Edward, &ldquo;that is if it suits Mrs.
      Quest. Perhaps she may object to carting me about the country.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not observed any such reluctance on her part,&rdquo; said
      the lawyer dryly, &ldquo;but we can easily settle the question. I must go
      home and get some plans before I attend the vestry meeting about that
      pinnacle. Will you step across with me and we can ask her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I have nothing particular to do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And accordingly, so soon as Mr. Quest had made some small arrangements and
      given particular directions to his clerks as to his whereabouts for the
      day, they set off together for the lawyer&rsquo;s private house.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. &mdash; MR. QUEST&rsquo;S WIFE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Quest lived in one of those ugly but comfortably-built old red brick
      houses which abound in almost every country town, and which give us the
      clearest possible idea of the want of taste and love of material comfort
      that characterised the age in which they were built. This house looked out
      on to the market place, and had a charming old walled garden at the back,
      famous for its nectarines, which, together with the lawn tennis court,
      was, as Mrs. Quest would say, almost enough to console her for living in a
      town. The front door, however, was only separated by a little flight of
      steps from the pavement upon which the house abutted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering a large, cool-looking hall, Mr. Quest paused and asked a servant
      who was passing there where her mistress was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the drawing-room, sir,&rdquo; said the girl; and, followed by
      Edward Cossey, he walked down a long panelled passage till he reached a
      door on the left. This he opened quickly and passed through into a
      charming, modern-looking room, handsomely and even luxuriously furnished,
      and lighted by French windows opening on to the walled garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little lady dressed in some black material was standing at one of these
      windows, her arms crossed behind her back, and absently gazing out of it.
      At the sound of the opening door she turned swiftly, her whole delicate
      and lovely face lighting up like a flower in a ray of sunshine, the lips
      slightly parted, and a deep and happy light shining in her violet eyes.
      Then, all in an instant, it was instructive to observe <i>how</i>
      instantaneously, her glance fell upon her husband (for the lady was Mrs.
      Quest) and her entire expression changed to one of cold aversion, the
      light fading out of her face as it does from a November sky, and leaving
      it cold and hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Quest, who was a man who saw everything, saw this also, and smiled
      bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed, Belle,&rdquo; he said in a low voice;
      &ldquo;I have brought Mr. Cossey with me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She flushed up to the eyes, a great wave of colour, and her breast heaved;
      but before she could answer, Edward Cossey, who had stopped behind to wipe
      some mud off his shoes, entered the room, and politely offered his hand to
      Mrs. Quest, who took it coldly enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an early visitor, Mr. Cossey,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said her husband, &ldquo;but the fault is mine. I have
      brought Mr. Cossey over to ask if you can give him a lift up to the Castle
      this afternoon. I have to go there to lunch, and have borrowed his
      dogcart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, with pleasure. But why can&rsquo;t the dogcart come back
      for Mr. Cossey?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo; put in Edward, &ldquo;there is a little
      difficulty; my groom is ill. But there is really no reason why you should
      be bothered. I have no doubt that a man can be found to bring it back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; she said, with a shrug, &ldquo;it will be all right;
      only you had better lunch here, that&rsquo;s all, because I want to start
      early, and go to an old woman&rsquo;s at the other end of Honham about
      some fuchsia cuttings.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be very happy,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well then, that is settled,&rdquo; said Mr. Quest, &ldquo;and
      now I must get my plans and be off to the vestry meeting. I&rsquo;m late
      as it is. With your permission, Mr. Cossey, I will order the dogcart as I
      pass your rooms.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Edward, and in another moment the lawyer was
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Quest watched the door close and then sat down in a low armchair, and
      resting her head upon the back, looked up with a steady, enquiring gaze,
      full into Edward Cossey&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he too looked at her and thought what a beautiful woman she was, in
      her own way. She was very small, rounded in her figure almost to
      stoutness, and possessed the tiniest and most beautiful hands and feet.
      But her greatest charm lay in the face, which was almost infantile in its
      shape, and delicate as a moss rose. She was exquisitely fair in colouring&mdash;indeed,
      the darkest things about her were her violet eyes, which in some lights
      looked almost black by contrast with her white forehead and waving auburn
      hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has my husband gone?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so. Why do you ask?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because from what I know of his habits I should think it very
      likely that he is listening behind the door,&rdquo; and she laughed
      faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to have a good opinion of him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have exactly the opinion of him which he deserves,&rdquo; she
      said bitterly; &ldquo;and my opinion of him is that he is one of the
      wickedest men in England.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he is behind the door he will enjoy that,&rdquo; said Edward
      Cossey. &ldquo;Well, if he is all this, why did you marry him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did I marry him?&rdquo; she answered with passion, &ldquo;because
      I was forced into it, bullied into it, starved into it. What would you do
      if you were a defenceless, motherless girl of eighteen, with a drunken
      father who beat you&mdash;yes, beat you with a stick&mdash;apologised in
      the most gentlemanlike way next morning and then went and got drunk again?
      And what would you do if that father were in the hands of a man like my
      husband, body and soul in his hands, and if between them pressure was
      brought to bear, and brought to bear, until at last&mdash;there, what is
      the good of going on it with&mdash;you can guess the rest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and what did he marry you for&mdash;your pretty face?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; he said so; it may have had something to do
      with it. I think it was my ten thousand pounds, for once I had a whole ten
      thousand pounds of my own, my poor mother left it me, and it was tied up
      so that my father could not touch it. Well, of course, when I married, my
      husband would not have any settlements, and so he took it, every farthing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did he do with it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spent it upon some other woman in London&mdash;most of it. I found
      him out; he gave her thousands of pounds at once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I should not have thought that he was so generous,&rdquo; he
      said with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused a moment and covered her face with her hand, and then went on:
      &ldquo;If you only knew, Edward, if you had the faintest idea what my life
      was till a year and a half ago, when I first saw you, you would pity me
      and understand why I am bad, and passionate, and jealous, and everything
      that I ought not to be. I never had any happiness as a girl &mdash;how
      could I in such a home as ours?&mdash;and then almost before I was a woman
      I was handed over to that man. Oh, how I hated him, and what I endured!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it can&rsquo;t have been very pleasant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pleasant&mdash;but there, we have done with each other now&mdash;we
      don&rsquo;t even speak much except in public, that&rsquo;s my price for
      holding my tongue about the lady in London and one or two other little
      things&mdash;so what is the use of talking of it? It was a horrible
      nightmare, but it has gone. And then,&rdquo; she went on, fixing her
      beautiful eyes upon his face, &ldquo;then I saw you, Edward, and for the
      first time in my life I learnt what love was, and I think that no woman
      ever loved like that before. Other women have had something to care for in
      their lives, I never had anything till I saw you. It may be wicked, but it&rsquo;s
      true.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned slightly away and said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, dear,&rdquo; she went on in a low voice, &ldquo;I think it
      has been one of the hardest things of all&mdash;my love for you. For,
      Edward,&rdquo; and she rose and took his hand and looked into his face
      with her soft full eyes full of tears, &ldquo;I should have liked to be a
      blessing to you, and not a curse, and&mdash;and&mdash;a cause of sin. Oh,
      Edward, I should have made you such a good wife, no man could have had a
      better, and I would have helped you too, for I am not such a fool as I
      seem, and now I shall do nothing but bring trouble upon you; I know I
      shall. And it was my fault too, at least most of it; don&rsquo;t ever
      think that I deceive myself, for I don&rsquo;t; I led you on, I know I
      did, I meant to&mdash;there! Think me as shameless as you like, I meant to
      from the first. And no good can come of it, I know that, although I would
      not have it undone. No good can ever come of what is wrong. I may be very
      wicked, but I know that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and she began to cry
      outright.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was too much for Edward Cossey, who, as any man must, had been much
      touched by this unexpected outburst. &ldquo;Look here, Belle,&rdquo; he
      blurted out on the impulse of the moment, &ldquo;I am sick and tired of
      all this sort of thing. For more than a year my life has been nothing but
      a living lie, and I can&rsquo;t stand it, and that&rsquo;s a fact. I tell
      you what it is: I think we had better just take the train to Paris and go
      off at once, or else give it all up. It is impossible to go on living in
      this atmosphere of continual falsehood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped crying. &ldquo;Do you really care for me enough for that,
      Edward?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he said, somewhat impatiently, &ldquo;you can see
      I do or I should not make the offer. Say the word and I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought for a moment, and then looked up again. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;no, Edward.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Are you afraid?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid!&rdquo; she answered with a gesture of contempt, &ldquo;what
      have I to be afraid of? Do you suppose such women as I am have any care
      for consequences? We have got beyond that&mdash;that is, for ourselves.
      But we can still feel a little for others. It would ruin you to do such a
      thing, socially and in every other way. You know you have often said that
      your father would cut you out of his will if you compromised yourself and
      him like that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, he would. I am sure of it. He would never forgive the
      scandal; he has a hatred of that sort of thing. But I could get a few
      thousands ready money, and we could change our names and go off to a
      colony or something.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very good of you to say so,&rdquo; she said humbly. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t deserve it, and I will not take advantage of you. You will be
      sorry that you made the offer by to-morrow. Ah, yes, I know it is only
      because I cried. No, we must go on as we are until the end comes, and then
      you can discard me; for all the blame will follow me, and I shall deserve
      it, too. I am older than you, you know, and a woman; and my husband will
      make some money out of you, and then it will all be forgotten, and I shall
      have had my day and go my own way to oblivion, like thousands of other
      unfortunate women before me, and it will be all the same a hundred years
      hence, don&rsquo;t you see? But, Edward, remember one thing. Don&rsquo;t
      play me any tricks, for I am not of the sort to bear it. Have patience and
      wait for the end; these things cannot last very long, and I shall never be
      a burden on you. Don&rsquo;t desert me or make me jealous, for I cannot
      bear it, I cannot, indeed, and I do not know what I might do&mdash;make a
      scandal or kill myself or you, I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t say what. You
      nearly sent me wild the other day when you were carrying on with Miss de
      la Molle&mdash;ah, yes, I saw it all&mdash;I have suspected you for a long
      time, and sometimes I think that you are really in love with her. And now,
      sir, I tell you what it is, we have had enough of this melancholy talk to
      last me for a month. Why did you come here at all this morning, just when
      I wanted to get you out of my head for an hour or two and think about my
      garden? I suppose it was a trick of Mr. Quest&rsquo;s bringing you here.
      He has got some fresh scheme on, I am sure of it from his face. Well, it
      can&rsquo;t be helped, and, since you are here, Mr. Edward Cossey, tell me
      how you like my new dress,&rdquo; and she posed herself and courtesied
      before him. &ldquo;Black, you see, to match my sins and show off my
      complexion. Doesn&rsquo;t it fit well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charmingly,&rdquo; he said, laughing in spite of himself, for he
      felt in no laughing mood, &ldquo;and now I tell you what it is, Belle, I
      am not going to stop here all the morning, and lunch, and that sort of
      thing. It does not look well, to say the least of it. The probability is
      that half the old women in Boisingham have got their eyes fixed on the
      hall door to see how long I stay. I shall go down to the office and come
      back at half-past two.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very nice excuse to get rid of me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I
      daresay you are right, and I want to see about the garden. There,
      good-bye, and mind you are not late, for I want to have a nice drive round
      to the Castle. Not that there is much need to warn you to be in time when
      you are going to see Miss de la Molle, is there? Good-bye, good-bye.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. &mdash; THE SHADOW OF RUIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Quest walked to his vestry meeting with a smile upon his thin,
      gentlemanly-looking face, and rage and bitterness in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I caught her that time,&rdquo; he said to himself; &ldquo;she can
      do a good deal in the way of deceit, but she can&rsquo;t keep the blood
      out of her cheeks when she hears that fellow&rsquo;s name. But she is a
      clever woman, Belle is &mdash;how well she managed that little business of
      the luncheon, and how well she fought her case when once she got me in a
      cleft stick about Edith and that money of hers, and made good terms too.
      Ah! that&rsquo;s the worst of it, she has the whip hand of me there; if I
      could ruin her she could ruin me, and it&rsquo;s no use cutting off one&rsquo;s
      nose to spite your face. Well! my fine lady,&rdquo; he went on with an
      ominous flash of his grey eyes, &ldquo;I shall be even with you yet. Give
      you enough rope and you will hang yourself. You love this fellow, I know
      that, and it will go hard if I can&rsquo;t make him break your heart for
      you. Bah! you don&rsquo;t know the sort of stuff men are made of. If only
      I did not happen to be in love with you myself I should not care. If&mdash;&mdash;Ah!
      here I am at the church.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The human animal is a very complicated machine, and can conduct the
      working of an extraordinary number of different interests and sets of
      ideas, almost, if not entirely, simultaneously. For instance, Mr. Quest&mdash;seated
      at the right hand of the rector in the vestry room of the beautiful old
      Boisingham Church, and engaged in an animated and even warm discussion
      with the senior curate on the details of fourteenth century Church work,
      in which he clearly took a lively interest and understood far better than
      did the curate&mdash;would have been exceedingly difficult to identify
      with the scheming, vindictive creature whom we have just followed up the
      church path. But after all, that is the way of human nature, although it
      may not be the way of those who try to draw it and who love to paint the
      villain black as the Evil One and the virtuous heroine so radiant that we
      begin to fancy we can hear the whispering of her wings. Few people are
      altogether good or altogether bad; indeed it is probable that the vast
      majority are neither good nor bad&mdash;they have not the strength to be
      the one or the other. Here and there, however, we do meet a spirit with
      sufficient will and originality to press the scale down this way or that,
      though even then the opposing force, be it good or evil, is constantly
      striving to bring the balance equal. Even the most wicked men have their
      redeeming points and righteous instincts, nor are their thoughts
      continually fixed upon iniquity. Mr. Quest, for instance, one of the evil
      geniuses of this history, was, where his plots and passions were not
      immediately concerned, a man of eminently generous and refined tendencies.
      Many were the good turns, contradictory as it may seem, that he had done
      to his poorer neighbours; he had even been known to forego his bills of
      costs, which is about the highest and rarest exhibition of earthly virtue
      that can be expected from a lawyer. He was moreover eminently a cultured
      man, a reader of the classics, in translations if not in the originals, a
      man with a fine taste in fiction and poetry, and a really sound and ripe
      archaeological knowledge, especially where sacred buildings were
      concerned. All his instincts, also, were towards respectability. His most
      burning ambition was to secure a high position in the county in which he
      lived, and to be classed among the resident gentry. He hated his lawyer&rsquo;s
      work, and longed to accumulate sufficient means to be able to give it the
      good-bye and to indulge himself in an existence of luxurious and learned
      leisure. Such as he was he had made himself, for he was the son of a poor
      and inferior country dentist, and had begun life with a good education, it
      is true, which he chiefly owed to his own exertions, but with nothing
      else. Had his nature been a temperate nature with a balance of good to its
      credit to draw upon instead of a balance of evil, he was a man who might
      have gone very far indeed, for in addition to his natural ability he had a
      great power of work. But unfortunately this was not the case; his
      instincts on the whole were evil instincts, and his passions&mdash;whether
      of hate, or love, or greed, when they seized him did so with extraordinary
      violence, rendering him for the time being utterly callous to the rights
      or feelings of others, provided that he attained his end. In short, had he
      been born to a good position and a large fortune, it is quite possible,
      providing always that his strong passions had not at some period of his
      life led him irremediably astray, that he would have lived virtuous and
      respected, and died in good odour, leaving behind him a happy memory. But
      fate had placed him in antagonism with the world, and yet had endowed him
      with a gnawing desire to be of the world, as it appeared most desirable to
      him; and then, to complete his ruin circumstances had thrown him into
      temptations from which inexperience and the headlong strength of his
      passions gave him no opportunity to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may at first appear strange that a man so calculating and whose desires
      seemed to be fixed upon such a material end as the acquirement by artifice
      or even fraud of the wealth which he coveted, should also nourish in his
      heart so bitter a hatred and so keen a thirst for revenge upon a woman as
      Mr. Quest undoubtedly did towards his beautiful wife. It would have seemed
      more probable that he would have left heroics alone and attempted to turn
      his wife&rsquo;s folly into a means of wealth and self-advancement: and
      this would no doubt have been so had Mrs. Quest&rsquo;s estimate of his
      motives in marrying her been an entirely correct one. She had told Edward
      Cossey, it will be remembered, that her husband had married her for her
      money&mdash;the ten thousand pounds of which he stood so badly in need.
      Now this was the truth to a certain extent, and a certain extent only. He
      had wanted the ten thousand pounds, in fact at the moment money was
      necessary to him. But, and this his wife had never known or realised, he
      had been, and still was, also in love with her. Possibly the ten thousand
      pounds would have proved a sufficient inducement to him without the love,
      but the love was none the less there. Their relations, however, had never
      been happy ones. She had detested him from the first, and had not spared
      to say so. No man with any refinement&mdash;and whatever he lacked Mr.
      Quest had refinement&mdash;could bear to be thus continually repulsed by a
      woman, and so it came to pass that their intercourse had always been of
      the most strained nature. Then when she at last had obtained the clue to
      the secret of his life, under threat of exposure she drove her bargain, of
      which the terms were complete separation in all but outward form, and
      virtual freedom of action for herself. This, considering the position, she
      was perhaps justified in doing, but her husband never forgave her for it.
      More than that, he determined, if by any means it were possible, to turn
      the passion which, although she did not know it, he was perfectly aware
      she bore towards his business superior, Edward Cossey, to a refined
      instrument of vengeance against her, with what success it will be one of
      the purposes of this history to show.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such, put as briefly as possible, were the outlines of the character and
      aims of this remarkable and contradictory man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within an hour and a half of leaving his own house, &ldquo;The Oaks,&rdquo;
      as it was called, although the trees from which it had been so named had
      long since vanished from the garden, Mr. Quest was bowling swiftly along
      behind Edward Cossey&rsquo;s powerful bay horse towards the towering
      gateway of Honham Castle. When he was within three hundred yards an idea
      struck him; he pulled the horse up sharply, for he was alone in the
      dogcart, and paused to admire the view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a beautiful place!&rdquo; he reflected to himself with
      enthusiasm, &ldquo;and how grandly those old towers stand out against the
      sky. The Squire has restored them very well, too, there is no doubt about
      it; I could not have done it better myself. I wonder if that place will
      ever be mine. Things look black now, but they may come round, and I think
      I am beginning to see my way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he started the horse on again, reflecting on the unpleasant
      nature of the business before him. Personally he both liked and respected
      the old Squire, and he certainly pitied him, though he would no more have
      dreamed of allowing his liking and pity to interfere with the prosecution
      of his schemes, than an ardent sportsman would dream of not shooting
      pheasants because he had happened to take a friendly interest in their
      nurture. He had also a certain gentlemanlike distaste to being the bearer
      of crushing bad news, for Mr. Quest disliked scenes, possibly because he
      had such an intimate personal acquaintance with them. Whilst he was still
      wondering how he might best deal with the matter, he passed over the moat
      and through the ancient gateway which he admired so fervently, and found
      himself in front of the hall door. Here he pulled up, looking about for
      somebody to take his horse, when suddenly the Squire himself emerged upon
      him with a rush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, Quest, is that you?&rdquo; he shouted, as though his visitor
      had been fifty yards off instead of five. &ldquo;I have been looking out
      for you. Here, William! William!&rdquo; (crescendo), &ldquo;William!&rdquo;
      (fortissimo), &ldquo;where on earth is the boy? I expect that idle fellow,
      George, has been sending him on some of his errands instead of attending
      to them himself. Whenever he is wanted to take a horse he is nowhere to be
      found, and then it is 'Please, sir, Mr. George,&rsquo; that&rsquo;s what
      he calls him, &lsquo;Please, sir, Mr. George sent me up to the Moat Farm
      or somewhere to see how many eggs the hens laid last week,&rsquo; or
      something of the sort. That&rsquo;s a very nice horse you have got there,
      by the way, very nice indeed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not my horse, Mr. de la Molle,&rdquo; said the lawyer, with a
      faint smile, &ldquo;it is Mr. Edward Cossey&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s Mr. Edward Cossey&rsquo;s, is it?&rdquo; answered
      the old gentleman with a sudden change of voice. &ldquo;Ah, Mr. Edward
      Cossey&rsquo;s? Well, it&rsquo;s a very good horse anyhow, and I suppose
      that Mr. Cossey can afford to buy good horses.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then a faint cry of &ldquo;Coming, sir, coming,&rdquo; was heard, and
      a long hobble-de-hoy kind of youth, whose business it was to look after
      the not extensive Castle stables, emerged in a great heat from round the
      corner of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, where on earth have you been?&rdquo; began the Squire, in a
      stentorian tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, sir, Mr. George&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, what did I tell you?&rdquo; broke in the Squire. &ldquo;Have
      I not told you time after time that you are to mind your own business, and
      leave &lsquo;Mr. George&rsquo; to mind his? Now take that horse round to
      the stables, and see that it is properly fed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Quest, come in. We have a quarter of an hour before luncheon,
      and can get our business over,&rdquo; and he led the way through the
      passage into the tapestried and panelled vestibule, where he took his
      stand before the empty fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Quest followed him, stopping, ostensibly to admire a particularly fine
      suit of armour which hung upon the wall, but really to gain another moment
      for reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A beautiful suit of the early Stuart period, Mr. de la Molle,&rdquo;
      he said; &ldquo;I never saw a better.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, that belonged to old Sir James, the one whom the
      Roundheads shot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! the Sir James who hid the treasure?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I was telling that story to our new neighbour, Colonel
      Quaritch, last night&mdash;a very nice fellow, by the way; you should go
      and call upon him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what he did with it,&rdquo; said Mr. Quest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, so do I, and so will many another, I dare say. I wish that I
      could find it, I&rsquo;m sure. It&rsquo;s wanted badly enough now-a-days.
      But that reminds me, Quest. You will have gathered my difficulty from my
      note and what George told you. You see this man Janter&mdash;thanks to
      that confounded fellow, Major Boston, and his action about those College
      Lands&mdash;has thrown up the Moat Farm, and George tells me that there is
      not another tenant to be had for love or money. In fact, you know what it
      is, one can&rsquo;t get tenants now-a-days, they simply are not to be had.
      Well, under these circumstances, there is, of course, only one thing to be
      done that I know of, and that is to take the farm in hand and farm it
      myself. It is quite impossible to let the place fall out of cultivation&mdash;and
      that is what would happen otherwise, for if I were to lay it down in grass
      it would cost a considerable sum, and be seven or eight years before I got
      any return.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire paused and Mr. Quest said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that being so, the next thing to do
      is to obtain the necessary cash to pay Janter his valuation and stock the
      place&mdash;about four thousand would do it, or perhaps,&rdquo; he added,
      with an access of generous confidence, &ldquo;we had better say five.
      There are about fifty acres of those low-lying meadows which want to be
      thoroughly bush drained&mdash;bushes are quite as good as pipes for that
      stiff land, if they put in the right sort of stuff, and it don&rsquo;t
      cost half so much&mdash;but still it can&rsquo;t be done for nothing, and
      then there is a new wagon shed wanted, and some odds and ends; yes, we had
      better say five thousand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Mr. Quest made no answer, so once more the Squire went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see, under these circumstances&mdash;not being able to
      lay hands upon the necessary capital from my private resources, of course
      I have made up my mind to apply to Cossey and Son for the loan. Indeed,
      considering how long and intimate has been the connection between their
      house and the de la Molle family, I think it right and proper to do so;
      indeed, I should consider it very wrong of me if I neglected to give them
      the opportunity of the investment&rdquo;&mdash;here a faint smile
      flickered for an instant on Mr. Quest&rsquo;s face and then went out&mdash;&ldquo;of
      course they will, as a matter of business, require security, and very
      properly so, but as this estate is unentailed, there will fortunately be
      very little difficulty about that. You can draw up the necessary deeds,
      and I think that under the circumstances the right thing to do would be to
      charge the Moat Farm specifically with the amount. Things are bad enough,
      no doubt, but I can hardly suppose it possible under any conceivable
      circumstances that the farm would not be good for five thousand pounds.
      However, they might perhaps prefer to have a general clause as well, and
      if it is so, although I consider it quite unnecessary, I shall raise no
      objection to that course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then at last Mr. Quest broke his somewhat ominous silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry to say, Mr. de la Molle,&rdquo; he said gently,
      &ldquo;that I can hold out no prospect of Cossey and Son being induced,
      under any circumstances, to advance another pound upon the security of the
      Honham Castle estates. Their opinion of the value of landed property as
      security has received so severe a shock, that they are not at all
      comfortable as to the safety of the amount already invested.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. de la Molle started when he heard this most unexpected bit of news,
      for which he was totally unprepared. He had always found it possible to
      borrow money, and it had never occurred to him that a time might perhaps
      come in this country, when the land, which he held in almost superstitious
      veneration, would be so valueless a form of property that lenders would
      refuse it as security.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he said, recovering himself, &ldquo;the total
      encumbrances on the property do not amount to more than twenty-five
      thousand pounds, and when I succeeded to my father, forty years ago, it
      was valued at fifty, and the Castle and premises have been thoroughly
      repaired since then at a cost of five thousand, and most of the farm
      buildings too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very possibly, de la Molle, but to be honest, I very much doubt if
      Honham Castle and the lands round it would now fetch twenty-five thousand
      pounds on a forced sale. Competition and Radical agitation have brought
      estates down more than people realise, and land in Australia and New
      Zealand is now worth almost as much per acre as cultivated lands in
      England. Perhaps as a residential property and on account of its
      historical interest it might fetch more, but I doubt it. In short, Mr. de
      la Molle, so anxious are Cossey and Son in the matter, that I regret to
      have to tell you that so far from being willing to make a further advance,
      the firm have formally instructed me to serve the usual six months&rsquo;
      notice on you, calling in the money already advanced on mortgage, together
      with the interest, which I must remind you is nearly a year overdue, and
      this step I propose to take to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman staggered for a moment, and caught at the mantelpiece,
      for the blow was a heavy one, and as unexpected as it was heavy. But he
      recovered himself in an instant, for it was one of the peculiarities of
      his character that his spirits always seemed to rise to the occasion in
      the face of urgent adversity&mdash;in short, he possessed an extraordinary
      share of moral courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; he said indignantly, &ldquo;indeed, it is a pity
      that you did not tell me that at once, Mr. Quest; it would have saved me
      from putting myself in a false position by proposing a business
      arrangement which is not acceptable. As regards the interest, I admit that
      it is as you say, and I very much regret it. That stupid fellow George is
      always so dreadfully behindhand with his accounts that I can never get
      anything settled.&rdquo; (He did not state, and indeed did not know, that
      the reason that the unfortunate George was behindhand was that there were
      no accounts to make up, or rather that they were all on the wrong side of
      the ledger). &ldquo;I will have that matter seen to at once. Of course,
      business people are quite right to consider their due, and I do not blame
      Messrs. Cossey in the matter, not in the least. Still, I must say that,
      considering the long and intimate relationship that has for nearly two
      centuries existed between their house and my family, they might&mdash;well&mdash;have
      shown a little more consideration.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Quest, &ldquo;I daresay that the step strikes
      you as a harsh one. To be perfectly frank with you, Mr. de la Molle, it
      struck me as a very harsh one; but, of course, I am only a servant, and
      bound to carry out my instructions. I sympathise with you very much&mdash;very
      much indeed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; said the old gentleman. &ldquo;Of
      course, other arrangements must be made; and, much as it will pain me to
      terminate my connection with Messrs. Cossey, they shall be made.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I think,&rdquo; went on the lawyer, without any notice of his
      interruption, &ldquo;that you misunderstand the matter a little. Cossey
      and Son are only a trading corporation, whose object is to make money by
      lending it, or otherwise&mdash;at all hazards to make money. The kind of
      feeling that you allude to, and that might induce them, in consideration
      of long intimacy and close connection in the past, to forego the
      opportunity of so doing and even to run a risk of loss, is a thing which
      belongs to former generations. But the present is a strictly commercial
      age, and we are the most commercial of the trading nations. Cossey and Son
      move with the times, that is all, and they would rather sell up a dozen
      families who had dealt with them for two centuries than lose five hundred
      pounds, provided, of course, that they could do so without scandal and
      loss of public respect, which, where a banking house is concerned, also
      means a loss of custom. I am a great lover of the past myself, and believe
      that our ancestors&rsquo; ways of doing business were, on the whole,
      better and more charitable than ours, but I have to make my living and
      take the world as I find it, Mr. de la Molle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, Quest; quite so,&rdquo; answered the Squire quietly.
      &ldquo;I had no idea that you looked at these matters in such a light.
      Certainly the world has changed a good deal since I was a young man, and I
      do not think it has changed much for the better. But you will want your
      luncheon; it is hungry work talking about foreclosures.&rdquo; Mr. Quest
      had not used this unpleasant word, but the Squire had seen his drift.
      &ldquo;Come into the next room,&rdquo; and he led the way to the
      drawing-room, where Ida was sitting reading the <i>Times</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ida,&rdquo; he said, with an affectation of heartiness which did
      not, however, deceive his daughter, who knew how to read every change of
      her dear father&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;here is Mr. Quest. Take him in to
      luncheon, my love. I will come presently. I want to finish a note.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he returned to the vestibule and sat down in his favourite old oak
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruined,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;I can never get the money
      as things are, and there will be a foreclosure. Well, I am an old man and
      I hope that I shall not live to see it. But there is Ida. Poor Ida! I
      cannot bear to think of it, and the old place too, after all these
      generations&mdash;after all these generations!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. &mdash; THE TENNIS PARTY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ida shook hands coldly enough with the lawyer, for whom she cherished a
      dislike not unmixed with fear. Many women are by nature gifted with an
      extraordinary power of intuition which fully makes up for their deficiency
      in reasoning force. They do not conclude from the premisses of their
      observation, they <i>know</i> that this man is to be feared and that
      trusted. In fact, they share with the rest of breathing creation that
      self-protective instinct of instantaneous and almost automatic judgment,
      given to guard it from the dangers with which it is continually threatened
      at the hands of man&rsquo;s over-mastering strength and ordered
      intelligence. Ida was one of these. She knew nothing to Mr. Quest&rsquo;s
      disadvantage, indeed she always heard him spoken of with great respect,
      and curiously enough she liked his wife. But she could not bear the man,
      feeling in her heart that he was not only to be avoided on account of his
      own hidden qualities, but that he was moreover an active personal enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went into the dining-room, where the luncheon was set, and while Ida
      allowed Mr. Quest to cut her some cold boiled beef, an operation in which
      he did not seem to be very much at home, she came to a rapid conclusion in
      her own mind. She had seen clearly enough from her father&rsquo;s face
      that his interview with the lawyer had been of a most serious character,
      but she knew that the chances were that she would never be able to get its
      upshot out of him, for the old gentleman had a curious habit of keeping
      such unpleasant matters to himself until he was absolutely forced by
      circumstances to reveal them. She also knew that her father&rsquo;s
      affairs were in a most critical condition, for this she had extracted from
      him on the previous night, and that if any remedy was to be attempted it
      must be attempted at once, and on some heroic scale. Therefore, she made
      up her mind to ask her <i>bete noire</i>, Mr. Quest, what the truth might
      be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Quest,&rdquo; she said, with some trepidation, as he at last
      triumphantly handed her the beef, &ldquo;I hope you will forgive me for
      asking you a plain question, and that, if you can, you will favour me with
      a plain answer. I know my father&rsquo;s affairs are very much involved,
      and that he is now anxious to borrow some more money; but I do not know
      quite how matters stand, and I want to learn the exact truth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad to hear you speak so, Miss de la Molle,&rdquo;
      answered the lawyer, &ldquo;because I was trying to make up my mind to
      broach the subject, which is a painful one to me. Frankly, then&mdash;forgive
      me for saying it, your father is absolutely ruined. The interest on the
      mortgages is a year in arrear, his largest farm has just been thrown upon
      his hands, and, to complete the tale, the mortgagees are going to call in
      their money or foreclose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this statement, which was almost brutal in its brief comprehensiveness,
      Ida turned pale as death, as well she might, and dropped her fork with a
      clatter upon the plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not realise that things were quite so bad,&rdquo; she
      murmured. &ldquo;Then I suppose that the place will be taken from us, and
      we shall&mdash;shall have to go away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, certainly, unless money can be found to take up the mortgages,
      of which I see no chance. The place will be sold for what it will fetch,
      and that now-a-days will be no great sum.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When will that be?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In about six or nine months&rsquo; time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida&rsquo;s lips trembled, and the sight of the food upon her plate became
      nauseous to her. A vision arose before her mind&rsquo;s eye of herself and
      her old father departing hand in hand from the Castle gates, behind and
      about which gleamed the hard wild lights of a March sunset, to seek a
      place to hide themselves. The vivid horror of the phantasy almost overcame
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there no way of escape?&rdquo; she asked hoarsely. &ldquo;To
      lose this place would kill my father. He loves it better than anything in
      the world; his whole life is wrapped up in it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can quite understand that, Miss de la Molle; it is a most
      charming old place, especially to anybody interested in the past. But
      unfortunately mortgagees are no respecters of feelings. To them land is so
      much property and nothing more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know all that,&rdquo; she said impatiently, &ldquo;you do not
      answer my question;&rdquo; and she leaned towards him, resting her hand
      upon the table. &ldquo;Is there no way out of it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Quest drank a little claret before he answered. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;I think that there is, if only you will take it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What way?&rdquo; she asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, though as I said just now, the mortgagees of an estate as a
      body are merely a business corporation, and look at things from a business
      point of view only, you must remember that they are composed of
      individuals, and that individuals can be influenced if they can be got at.
      For instance, Cossey and Son are an abstraction and harshly disposed in
      their abstract capacity, but Mr. Edward Cossey is an individual, and I
      should say, so far as this particular matter is concerned, a benevolently
      disposed individual. Now Mr. Edward Cossey is not himself at the present
      moment actually one of the firm of Cossey and Son, but he is the heir of
      the head of the house, and of course has authority, and, what is better
      still, the command of money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Ida. &ldquo;You mean that my father
      should try to win over Mr. Edward Cossey. Unfortunately, to be frank, he
      dislikes him, and my father is not a man to keep his dislikes to himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People generally do dislike those to whom they are crushingly
      indebted; your father dislikes Mr. Cossey because his name is Cossey, and
      for no other reason. But that is not quite what I meant&mdash;I do not
      think that the Squire is the right person to undertake a negotiation of
      the sort. He is a little too outspoken and incautious. No, Miss de la
      Molle, if it is to be done at all <i>you</i> must do it. You must put the
      whole case before him at once&mdash;this very afternoon, there is no time
      for delay; you need not enter into details, he knows all about them&mdash;only
      ask him to avert this catastrophe. He can do so if he likes, how he does
      it is his own affair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Mr. Quest,&rdquo; said Ida, &ldquo;how can I ask such a favour
      of any man? I shall be putting myself in a dreadfully false position.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not pretend, Miss de la Molle, that it is a pleasant task for
      any young lady to undertake. I quite understand your shrinking from it.
      But sometimes one has to do unpleasant things and make compromises with
      one&rsquo;s self-respect. It is a question whether or no your family shall
      be utterly ruined and destroyed. There is, as I honestly believe, no
      prospect whatever of your father being able to get the money to pay off
      Cossey and Son, and if he did, it would not help him, because he could not
      pay the interest on it. Under these circumstances you have to choose
      between putting yourself in an equivocal position and letting events take
      their course. It would be useless for anybody else to undertake the task,
      and of course I cannot guarantee that even you will succeed, but I will
      not mince matters&mdash;as you doubtless know, any man would find it hard
      to refuse a favour asked by such a suppliant. And now you must make up
      your own mind. I have shown you a path that may lead your family from a
      position of the most imminent peril. If you are the woman I take you for,
      you will not shrink from following it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida made no reply, and in another moment the Squire came in to take a
      couple of glasses of sherry and a biscuit. But Mr. Quest, furtively
      watching her face, said to himself that she had taken the bait and that
      she would do it. Shortly after this a diversion occurred, for the
      clergyman, Mr. Jeffries, a pleasant little man, with a round and shining
      face and a most unclerical eyeglass, came up to consult the Squire upon
      some matter of parish business, and was shown into the dining-room. Ida
      took advantage of his appearance to effect a retreat to her own room, and
      there for the present we may leave her to her meditations.
    </p>
    <p>
      No more business was discussed by the Squire that afternoon. Indeed it
      interested Mr. Quest, who was above all things a student of character, to
      observe how wonderfully the old gentleman threw off his trouble. To listen
      to him energetically arguing with the Rev. Mr. Jeffries as to whether or
      no it would be proper, as had hitherto been the custom, to devote the
      proceeds of the harvest festival collection (1 pound 18s. 3d. and a brass
      button) to the county hospital, or whether it should be applied to the
      repair of the woodwork in the vestry, was under the circumstances most
      instructive. The Rev. Mr. Jeffries, who suffered severely from the
      condition of the vestry, at last gained his point by triumphantly showing
      that no patient from Honham had been admitted to the hospital for fifteen
      months, and that therefore the hospital had no claim on this particular
      year, whereas the draught in the vestry was enough to cut any clergyman in
      two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, &ldquo;I will consent
      for this year, and this year only. I have been churchwarden of this parish
      for between forty and fifty years, and we have always given the harvest
      festival collection to the hospital, and although under these exceptional
      circumstances it may possibly be desirable to diverge from that custom, I
      cannot and will not consent to such a thing in a permanent way. So I shall
      write to the secretary and explain the matter, and tell him that next year
      and in the future generally the collection will be devoted to its original
      purpose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo; ejaculated Mr. Quest to himself. &ldquo;And
      the man must know that in all human probability the place will be sold
      over his head before he is a year older. I wonder if he puts it on or if
      he deceives himself. I suppose he has lived here so long that he cannot
      realise a condition of things under which he will cease to live here and
      the place will belong to somebody else. Or perhaps he is only brazening it
      out.&rdquo; And then he strolled away to the back of the house and had a
      look at the condition of the outhouses, reflecting that some of them would
      be sadly expensive to repair for whoever came into possession here. After
      that he crossed the moat and walked through the somewhat extensive
      plantations at the back of the house, wondering if it would not be
      possible to get enough timber out of them, if one went to work
      judiciously, to pay for putting the place in order. Presently he came to a
      hedgerow where a row of very fine timber oaks had stood, of which the
      Squire had been notoriously fond, and of which he had himself taken
      particular and admiring notice in the course of the previous winter. The
      trees were gone. In the hedge where they had grown were a series of gaps
      like those in an old woman&rsquo;s jaw, and the ground was still littered
      with remains of bark and branches and of faggots that had been made up
      from the brushwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut down this spring fell,&rdquo; was Mr. Quest&rsquo;s
      ejaculation. &ldquo;Poor old gentleman, he must have been pinched before
      he consented to part with those oaks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he turned and went back to the house, just in time to see Ida&rsquo;s
      guests arriving for the lawn tennis party. Ida herself was standing on the
      lawn behind the house, which, bordered as it was by the moat and at the
      further end by a row of ruined arches, was one of the most picturesque in
      the country and a very effective setting to any young lady. As the people
      came they were shown through the house on to the lawn, and here she was
      receiving them. She was dressed in a plain, tight-fitting gown of blue
      flannel, which showed off her perfect figure to great advantage, and a
      broad-brimmed hat, that shaded her fine and dignified face. Mr. Quest sat
      down on a bench beneath the shade of an arbutus, watching her closely, and
      indeed, if the study of a perfect English lady of the noblest sort has any
      charms, he was not without his reward. There are some women&mdash;most of
      us know one or two&mdash;who are born to hold a great position and to sail
      across the world like a swan through meaner fowl. It would be very hard to
      say to what their peculiar charm and dignity is owing. It is not to beauty
      only, for though they have presence, many of these women are not
      beautiful, while some are even plain. Nor does it spring from native grace
      and tact alone; though these things must be present. Rather perhaps it is
      the reflection of a cultivated intellect acting upon a naturally pure and
      elevated temperament, which makes these ladies conspicuous and fashions
      them in such kind that all men, putting aside the mere charm of beauty and
      the natural softening of judgment in the atmosphere of sex, must recognise
      in them an equal mind, and a presence more noble than their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a woman was Ida de la Molle, and if any one doubted it, it was
      sufficient to compare her in her simplicity to the various human items by
      whom she was surrounded. They were a typical county society gathering,
      such as needs no description, and would not greatly interest if described;
      neither very good nor very bad, very handsome nor very plain, but moving
      religiously within the lines of custom and on the ground of commonplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is no wonder, then, that a woman like Ida de la Molle was <i>facile
      princeps</i> among such company, or that Harold Quaritch, who was somewhat
      poetically inclined for a man of his age, at any rate where the lady in
      question was concerned, should in his heart have compared her to a queen.
      Even Belle Quest, lovely as she undoubtedly was in her own way, paled and
      looked shopgirlish in face of that gentle dignity, a fact of which she was
      evidently aware, for although the two women were friendly, nothing would
      induce the latter to stand long near Ida in public. She would tell Edward
      Cossey that it made her look like a wax doll beside a live child.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Mr. Quest was still watching Ida with complete satisfaction, for she
      appealed to the artistic side of his nature, Colonel Quaritch arrived upon
      the scene, looking, Mr. Quest thought, particularly plain with his solid
      form, his long thin nose, light whiskers, and square massive chin. Also he
      looked particularly imposing in contrast to the youths and maidens and
      domesticated clergymen. There was a gravity, almost a solemnity, about his
      bronzed countenance and deliberate ordered conversation, which did not,
      however, favourably impress the aforesaid youths and maidens, if a
      judgment might be formed from such samples of conversational criticism as
      Mr. Quest heard going on on the further side of his arbutus.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. &mdash; IDA&rsquo;S BARGAIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Ida saw the Colonel coming, she put on her sweetest smile and took
      his outstretched hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Colonel Quaritch?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is very
      good of you to come, especially as you don&rsquo;t play tennis much&mdash;by
      the way, I hope you have been studying that cypher, for I am sure it is a
      cypher.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I studied it for half-an-hour before I went to bed last night, Miss
      de la Molle, and for the life of me I could not make anything out of it,
      and what&rsquo;s more, I don&rsquo;t think that there is anything to make
      out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she answered with a sigh, &ldquo;I wish there was.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll have another try at it. What will you give me if I
      find it out?&rdquo; he said with a smile which lighted up his rugged face
      most pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything you like to ask and that I can give,&rdquo; she answered
      in a tone of earnestness which struck him as peculiar, for of course he
      did not know the news that she had just heard from Mr. Quest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then for the first time for many years, Harold Quaritch delivered himself
      of a speech that might have been capable of a tender and hidden meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he said, bowing, &ldquo;that if I came to claim
      the reward, I should ask for more even that you would be inclined to give.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida blushed a little. &ldquo;We can consider that when you do come,
      Colonel Quaritch&mdash;excuse me, but here are Mrs. Quest and Mr. Cossey,
      and I must go and say how do you do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold Quaritch looked round, feeling unreasonably irritated at this
      interruption to his little advances, and for the first time saw Edward
      Cossey. He was coming along in the wake of Mrs. Quest, looking very
      handsome and rather languid, when their eyes met, and to speak the truth,
      the Colonel&rsquo;s first impression was not a complimentary one. Edward
      Cossey was in some ways not a bad fellow, but like a great many young men
      who are born with silver spoons in their mouths, he had many airs and
      graces, one of which was the affectation of treating older and better men
      with an assumption of off-handedness and even of superiority that was
      rather obnoxious. Thus while Ida was greeting Mr. Quest, he was engaged in
      taking in the Colonel in a way which irritated that gentleman
      considerably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Ida turned and introduced Colonel Quaritch, first to Mrs. Quest
      and then to Mr. Cossey. Harold bowed to each, and then strolled off to
      meet the Squire, whom he noted advancing with his usual array of
      protective towels hanging out of his hat, and for a while saw neither of
      them any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Mr. Quest had emerged from the shelter of his arbutus, and going
      from one person to another, said some pleasant and appropriate word to
      each, till at last he reached the spot where his wife and Edward Cossey
      were standing. Nodding affectionately at the former, he asked her if she
      was not going to play tennis, and then drew Cossey aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Quest,&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;have you told the old
      man?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I told him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he take it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, talked it off and said that of course other arrangements must
      be made. I spoke to Miss de la Molle too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Edward, in a changed tone, &ldquo;and how did
      she take it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered the lawyer, putting on an air of deep concern
      (and as a matter of fact he really did feel sorry for her), &ldquo;I think
      it was the most painful professional experience that I ever had. The poor
      woman was utterly crushed. She said that it would kill her father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor girl!&rdquo; said Mr. Cossey, in a voice that showed his
      sympathy to be of a very active order, &ldquo;and how pluckily she is
      carrying it off too&mdash;look at her,&rdquo; and he pointed to where Ida
      was standing, a lawn tennis bat in her hand and laughingly arranging a
      &ldquo;set&rdquo; of married <i>versus</i> single.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she is a spirited girl,&rdquo; answered Mr. Quest, &ldquo;and
      what a splendid woman she looks, doesn&rsquo;t she? I never saw anybody
      who was so perfect a lady&mdash;there is nobody to touch her round here,
      unless,&rdquo; he added meditatively, &ldquo;perhaps it is Belle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are different types of beauty,&rdquo; answered Edward Cossey,
      flinching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but equally striking in their separate ways. Well, it can&rsquo;t
      be helped, but I feel sorry for that poor woman, and the old gentleman too&mdash;ah,
      there he is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was speaking the Squire, who was walking past with Colonel Quaritch,
      with the object of showing him the view from the end of the moat, suddenly
      came face to face with Edward Cossey. He at once stepped forward to greet
      him, but to his surprise was met by a cold and most stately bow from Mr.
      de la Molle, who passed on without vouchsafing a single word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old idiot!&rdquo; ejaculated Mr. Quest to himself, &ldquo;he will
      put Cossey&rsquo;s back up and spoil the game.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Edward aloud and colouring almost to his eyes.
      &ldquo;That old gentleman knows how to be insolent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not mind him, Mr. Cossey,&rdquo; answered Quest hastily.
      &ldquo;The poor old boy has a very good idea of himself&mdash;he is
      dreadfully injured because Cossey and Son are calling in the mortgages
      after the family has dealt with them for so many generations; and he
      thinks that you have something to do with it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well if he does he might as well be civil. It does not particularly
      incline a fellow to go aside to pull him out of the ditch, just to be cut
      in that fashion&mdash;I have half a mind to order my trap and go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, don&rsquo;t do that&mdash;you must make allowances, you
      must indeed&mdash;look, here is Miss de la Molle coming to ask you to play
      tennis.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Ida arrived and took off Edward Cossey with her, not a
      little to the relief of Mr. Quest, who began to fear that the whole scheme
      was spoiled by the Squire&rsquo;s unfortunate magnificence of manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward played his game, having Ida herself as his partner. It cannot be
      said that the set was a pleasant one for the latter, who, poor woman, was
      doing her utmost to bring up her courage to the point necessary to the
      carrying out of the appeal <i>ad misericordiam</i>, which she had decided
      to make as soon as the game was over. However, chance put an opportunity
      in her way, for Edward Cossey, who had a curious weakness for flowers,
      asked her if she would show him her chrysanthemums, of which she was very
      proud. She consented readily enough. They crossed the lawn, and passing
      through some shrubbery reached the greenhouse, which was placed at the end
      of the Castle itself. Here for some minutes they looked at the flowers,
      just now bursting into bloom. Ida, who felt exceedingly nervous, was all
      the while wondering how on earth she could broach so delicate a subject,
      when fortunately Mr. Cossey himself gave her the necessary opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine, Miss de la Molle,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what
      I have done to offend your father&mdash;he almost cut me just now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure that he saw you, Mr. Cossey; he is very absent-minded
      sometimes?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, he saw me, but when I offered to shake hands with him he
      only bowed in rather a crushing way and passed on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida broke off a Scarlet Turk from its stem, and nervously began to pick
      the bloom to pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, Mr. Cossey&mdash;the fact is, my father, and indeed I
      also, are in great trouble just now, about money matters you know, and my
      father is very apt to be prejudiced,&mdash;in short, I rather believe that
      he thinks you may have something to do with his difficulties&mdash;but
      perhaps you know all about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know something, Miss de la Molle,&rdquo; said he gravely, &ldquo;and
      I hope and trust you do not believe that I have anything to do with the
      action which Cossey and Son have thought fit to take.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she said hastily. &ldquo;I never thought anything of
      the sort&mdash;but I know that you have influence&mdash;and, well, to be
      plain, Mr. Cossey, I implore of you to use it. Perhaps you will understand
      that this is very humiliating for me to be obliged to ask this, though you
      can never guess <i>how</i> humiliating. Believe me, Mr. Cossey, I would
      never ask it for myself, but it is for my father&mdash;he loves this place
      better than his life; it would be much better he should die than that he
      should be obliged to leave it; and if this money is called in, that is
      what must happen, because the place will be sold over us. I believe he
      would go mad, I do indeed,&rdquo; and she stopped speaking and stood
      before him, the fragment of the flower in her hand, her breast heaving
      with emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you suggest should be done, Miss de la Molle?&rdquo; said
      Edward Cossey gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suggest that&mdash;that&mdash;if you will be so kind, you should
      persuade Cossey and Son to forego their intention of calling in the money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite impossible,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;My father
      ordered the step himself, and he is a hard man. It is impossible to turn
      him if he thinks he will lose money by turning. You see he is a banker,
      and has been handling money all his life, till it has become a sort of god
      to him. Really I do believe that he would rather beggar every friend he
      has than lose five thousand pounds.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there is no more to be said. The place must go, that&rsquo;s
      all,&rdquo; replied Ida, turning away her head and affecting to busy
      herself in removing some dried leaves from a chrysanthemum plant. Edward,
      watching her however, saw her shoulders shake and a big tear fall like a
      raindrop on the pavement, and the sight, strongly attracted as he was and
      had for some time been towards the young lady, was altogether too much for
      him. In an instant, moved by an overwhelming impulse, and something not
      unlike a gust of passion, he came to one of those determinations which so
      often change the whole course and tenour of men&rsquo;s lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss de la Molle,&rdquo; he said rapidly, &ldquo;there may be a way
      found out of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up enquiringly, and there were the tear stains on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody might take up the mortgages and pay off Cossey and Son.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you find anyone who will?&rdquo; she asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not as an investment. I understand that thirty thousand pounds
      are required, and I tell you frankly that as times are I do not for one
      moment believe the place to be worth that amount. It is all very well for
      your father to talk about land recovering itself, but at present, at any
      rate, nobody can see the faintest chance of anything of the sort. The
      probabilities are, on the contrary, that as the American competition
      increases, land will gradually sink to something like a prairie value.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how can money be got if nobody will advance it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not say that nobody will advance it; I said that nobody would
      advance it as an investment&mdash;a friend might advance it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where is such a friend to be found? He must be a very
      disinterested friend who would advance thirty thousand pounds.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody in this world is quite disinterested, Miss de la Molle; or
      at any rate very few are. What would you give to such a friend?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would give anything and everything over which I have control in
      this world, to save my father from seeing Honham sold over his head,&rdquo;
      she answered simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward Cossey laughed a little. &ldquo;That is a large order,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;Miss de la Molle, <i>I</i> am disposed to try and find the
      money to take up these mortgages. I have not got it, and I shall have to
      borrow it, and what is more, I shall have to keep the fact that I have
      borrowed it a secret from my father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very good of you,&rdquo; said Ida faintly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      know what to say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he made no reply, and looking at him, Ida saw that his hand
      was trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss de la Molle,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there is another matter of
      which I wish to speak to you. Men are sometimes put into strange
      positions, partly through their own fault, partly by force of
      circumstances, and when in those positions, are forced down paths that
      they would not follow. Supposing, Miss de la Molle, that mine were some
      such position, and supposing that owing to that position I could not say
      to you words which I should wish to say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida began to understand now and once more turned aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supposing, however, that at some future time the difficulties of
      that position of which I have spoken were to fade away, and I were then to
      speak those words, can you, supposing all this&mdash;tell me how they
      would be received?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida paused, and thought. She was a strong-natured and clear-headed woman,
      and she fully understood the position. On her answer would depend whether
      or no the thirty thousand pounds were forthcoming, and therefore, whether
      or no Honham Castle would pass from her father and her race.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said just now, Mr. Cossey,&rdquo; she answered coldly, &ldquo;that
      I would give anything and everything over which I have control in the
      world, to save my father from seeing Honham sold over his head. I do not
      wish to retract those words, and I think that in them you will find an
      answer to your question.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He coloured. &ldquo;You put the matter in a very business-like way,&rdquo;
      he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is best put so, Mr. Cossey,&rdquo; she answered with a faint
      shade of bitterness in her tone; &ldquo;it preserves me from feeling under
      an obligation&mdash;will you see my father about these mortgages?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to-morrow. And now I will say good-bye to you,&rdquo; and he
      took her hand, and with some little hesitation kissed it. She made no
      resistance and showed no emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;we have been here some time; Mrs.
      Quest will wonder what has become of you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a random arrow, but it went straight home, and for the third time
      that day Edward Cossey reddened to the roots of his hair. Without
      answering a word he bowed and went.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ida saw this, she was sorry she had made the remark, for she had no
      wish to appear to Mr. Cossey (the conquest of whom gave her neither pride
      nor pleasure) in the light of a spiteful, or worst still, of a jealous
      woman. She had indeed heard some talk about him and Mrs. Quest, but not
      being of a scandal-loving disposition it had not interested her, and she
      had almost forgotten it. Now however she learned that there was something
      in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that is the difficult position of which he talks,&rdquo; she
      said to herself; &ldquo;he wants to marry me as soon as he can get Mrs.
      Quest off his hands. And I have consented to that, always provided that
      Mrs. Quest can be disposed of, in consideration of the receipt of a sum of
      thirty thousand pounds. And I do not like the man. It was not nice of him
      to make that bargain, though I brought it on myself. I wonder if my father
      will ever know what I have done for him, and if he will appreciate it when
      he does. Well, it is not a bad price&mdash;thirty thousand pounds&mdash;a
      good figure for any woman in the present state of the market.&rdquo; And
      with a hard and bitter laugh, and a prescience of sorrow to come lying at
      the heart, she threw down the remains of the Scarlet Turk and turned away.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. &mdash; GEORGE PROPHESIES
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ida, for obvious reasons, said nothing to her father of her interview with
      Edward Cossey, and thus it came to pass that on the morning following the
      lawn tennis party, there was a very serious consultation between the
      faithful George and his master. It appeared to Ida, who was lying awake in
      her room, to commence somewhere about daybreak, and it certainly continued
      with short intervals for refreshment till eleven o&rsquo;clock in the
      forenoon. First the Squire explained the whole question to George at great
      length, and with a most extraordinary multiplicity of detail, for he began
      at his first loan from the house of Cossey and Son, which he had
      contracted a great many years before. All this while George sat with a
      very long face, and tried to look as though he were following the thread
      of the argument, which was not possible, for his master had long ago lost
      it himself, and was mixing up the loan of 1863 with the loan of 1874, and
      the money raised in the severance of the entail with both, in a way which
      would have driven anybody except George, who was used to this sort of
      thing, perfectly mad. However he sat it through, and when at last the
      account was finished, remarked that things &ldquo;sartainly did look
      queer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon the Squire called him a stupid owl, and having by means of some
      test questions discovered that he knew very little of the details which
      had just been explained to him at such portentous length, in spite of the
      protest of the wretched George, who urged that they &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t
      seem to be gitting no forrader somehow,&rdquo; he began and went through
      every word of it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      This brought them to breakfast time, and after breakfast, George&rsquo;s
      accounts were thoroughly gone into, with the result that confusion was
      soon worse confounded, for either George could not keep accounts or the
      Squire could not follow them. Ida, sitting in the drawing-room, could
      occasionally hear her father&rsquo;s ejaculatory outbursts after this
      kind:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you stupid donkey, you&rsquo;ve added it up all wrong, it&rsquo;s
      nine hundred and fifty, not three hundred and fifty;&rdquo; followed by a
      &ldquo;No, no, Squire, you be a-looking on the wrong side&mdash;them there
      is the dibits,&rdquo; and so on till both parties were fairly played out,
      and the only thing that remained clear was that the balance was
      considerably on the wrong side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Squire at last, &ldquo;there you are, you
      see. It appears to me that I am absolutely ruined, and upon my word I
      believe that it is a great deal owing to your stupidity. You have muddled
      and muddled and muddled till at last you have muddled us out of house and
      home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Squire, don&rsquo;t say that&mdash;don&rsquo;t you say
      that. It ain&rsquo;t none of my doing, for I&rsquo;ve been a good sarvant
      to you if I haven&rsquo;t had much book larning. It&rsquo;s that there
      dratted borrowing, that&rsquo;s what it is, and the interest and all the
      rest on it, and though I says it as didn&rsquo;t ought, poor Mr. James,
      God rest him and his free-handed ways. Don&rsquo;t you say it&rsquo;s me,
      Squire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; answered his master, &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t
      much matter whose fault it is, the result is the same, George; I&rsquo;m
      ruined, and I suppose that the place will be sold if anybody can be found
      to buy it. The de la Molles have been here between four and five
      centuries, and they got it by marriage with the Boisseys, who got it from
      the Norman kings, and now it will go to the hammer and be bought by a
      picture dealer, or a manufacturer of brandy, or someone of that sort.
      Well, everything has its end and God&rsquo;s will be done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Squire, don&rsquo;t you talk like that,&rdquo; answered
      George with emotion. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear to hear you talk like that.
      And what&rsquo;s more it ain&rsquo;t so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; asked the old gentleman sharply.
      &ldquo;It <i>is</i> so, there&rsquo;s no getting over it unless you can
      find thirty thousand pounds or thereabouts, to take up these mortgages
      with. Nothing short of a miracle can save it. That&rsquo;s always your
      way. &lsquo;Oh, something will turn up, something will turn up.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thin there&rsquo;ll be a miricle,&rdquo; said George, bringing down
      a fist like a leg of mutton with a thud upon the table, &ldquo;it ain&rsquo;t
      no use of your talking to me, Squire. I knaw it, I tell you I knaw it.
      There&rsquo;ll never be no other than a de la Molle up at the Castle while
      we&rsquo;re alive, no, nor while our childer is alive either. If the money&rsquo;s
      to be found, why drat it, it will be found. Don&rsquo;t you think that God
      Almighty is going to put none of them there counter jumpers into Honham
      Castle, where gentlefolk hev lived all these ginerations, because He ain&rsquo;t.
      There, and that&rsquo;s the truth, because I knaw it and so help me God&mdash;and
      if I&rsquo;m wrong it&rsquo;s a master one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire, who was striding up and down the room in his irritation,
      stopped suddenly in his walk, and looked at his retainer with a sharp and
      searching gaze upon his noble features. Notwithstanding his prejudices,
      his simplicity, and his occasional absurdities, he was in his own way an
      able man, and an excellent judge of human nature. Even his prejudices were
      as a rule founded upon some solid ground, only it was as a general rule
      impossible to get at it. Also he had a share of that marvellous instinct
      which, when it exists, registers the mental altitude of the minds of
      others with the accuracy of an aneroid. He could tell when a man&rsquo;s
      words rang true and when they rang false, and what is more when the
      conviction of the true, and the falsity of the false, rested upon a
      substantial basis of fact or error. Of course the instinct was a vague,
      and from its nature an undefinable one, but it existed, and in the present
      instance arose in strength. He looked at the ugly melancholy countenance
      of the faithful George with that keen glance of his, and observed that for
      the moment it was almost beautiful&mdash;beautiful in the light of
      conviction which shone upon it. He looked, and it was borne in upon him
      that what George said was true, and that George knew it was true, although
      he did not know where the light of truth came from, and as he looked half
      the load fell from his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, George, are you turning prophet in addition to your other
      occupations?&rdquo; he said cheerfully, and as he did so Edward Cossey&rsquo;s
      splendid bay horse pulled up at the door and the bell rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he added as soon as he saw who his visitor was,
      &ldquo;unless I am much mistaken, we shall soon know how much truth there
      is in your prophecies, for here comes Mr. Cossey himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before George could sufficiently recover from his recent agitation to make
      any reply, Edward Cossey, looking particularly handsome and rather
      overpowering, was shown into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire shook hands with him this time, though coldly enough, and
      George touched his forelock and said, &ldquo;Sarvant, sir,&rdquo; in the
      approved fashion. Thereon his master told him that he might retire, though
      he was to be sure not to go out of hearing, as he should want him again
      presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; answered George, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just step
      up to the Poplars. I told a man to be round there to-day, as I want to see
      if I can come to an understanding with him about this year&rsquo;s fell in
      the big wood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said the Squire with an expression of infinite
      disgust, &ldquo;there, that&rsquo;s just like your way, your horrid
      cadging way; the idea of telling a man to be &lsquo;round about the
      Poplars&rsquo; sometime or other to-day, because you wanted to speak to
      him about a fell. Why didn&rsquo;t you write him a letter like an ordinary
      Christian and make an offer, instead of dodging him round a farm for half
      a day like a wild Indian? Besides, the Poplars is half a mile off, if it&rsquo;s
      a yard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, sir,&rdquo; said George as he retired, &ldquo;that ain&rsquo;t
      the way that folks in these parts like to do business, that ain&rsquo;t.
      Letter writing is all very well for Londoners and other furriners, but it
      don&rsquo;t do here. Besides, sir, I shall hear you well enough up there.
      Sarvant, sir!&rdquo; this to Edward Cossey, and he was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward burst out laughing, and the Squire looked after his retainer with a
      comical air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder that the place has got into a mess with such a fellow as
      that to manage it,&rdquo; he said aloud. &ldquo;The idea of hunting a man
      round the Poplars Farm like&mdash;like an Indian squaw! He&rsquo;s a
      regular cadger, that&rsquo;s what he is, and that&rsquo;s all he&rsquo;s
      fit for. However, it&rsquo;s his way of doing business and I shan&rsquo;t
      alter him. Well, Mr. Cossey,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;this is a very sad
      state of affairs, at any rate so far as I am concerned. I presume of
      course that you know of the steps which have been taken by Cossey and Son
      to force a foreclosure, for that is what it amounts to, though I have not
      as yet received the formal notice; indeed, I suppose that those steps have
      been taken under your advice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mr. de la Molle, I know all about it, and here is the notice
      calling in the loans,&rdquo; and he placed a folded paper on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the Squire, &ldquo;I see. As I remarked to your
      manager, Mr. Quest, yesterday, I think that considering the nature of the
      relationship which has existed for so many generations between our family
      and the business firm of which you are a member, considering too the
      peculiar circumstances in which the owners of land find themselves at this
      moment, and the ruinous loss&mdash;to put questions of sentiment aside&mdash;that
      must be inflicted by such sale upon the owner of property, more
      consideration might have been shown. However, it is useless to try to make
      a silk purse out of a sow&rsquo;s ear, or to get blood from a stone, so I
      suppose that I must make the best of a bad job&mdash;and,&rdquo; with a
      most polite bow&mdash;&ldquo;I really do not know that I have anything
      more to say to you, Mr. Cossey. I will forward the notice to my lawyers;
      indeed I think that it might have been sent to them in the first instance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward Cossey had all this while been sitting on an old oak chair, his
      eyes fixed upon the ground, and slowly swinging his hat between his legs.
      Suddenly he looked up and to the Squire&rsquo;s surprise said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite agree with you. I don&rsquo;t think that you can say
      anything too bad about the behaviour of my people. A Shoreditch Jew could
      not have done worse. And look here, Mr. de la Molle, to come to the point
      and prevent misunderstanding, I may as well say at once that with your
      permission, I am anxious to take up these mortgages myself, for two
      reasons; I regard them as a desirable investment even in the present
      condition of land, and also I wish to save Cossey and Son from the
      discredit of the step which they meditate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For the second time that morning the Squire looked up with the sharp and
      searching gaze he occasionally assumed, and for the second time his
      instinct, for he was too heady a man to reason overmuch, came into play
      and warned him that in making this offer Edward Cossey had other motives
      than those which he had brought forward. He paused to consider what they
      might be. Was he anxious to get the estate for himself? Was he put forward
      by somebody else? Quest, perhaps; or was it something to do with Ida? The
      first alternative seemed the most probable to him. But whatever the lender&rsquo;s
      object, the result to him was the same, it gave him a respite. For Mr. de
      la Molle well knew that he had no more chance of raising the money from an
      ordinary source, than he had of altering the condition of agriculture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is an important matter, a most
      important matter. I presume, Mr. Cossey, that before making this definite
      offer you have consulted a legal adviser.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I have done all that and am quite satisfied with the
      security &mdash;an advance of thirty thousand charged on all the Honham
      Castle estates at four per cent. The question now is if you are prepared
      to consent to the transfer. In that case all the old charges on the
      property will be paid off, and Mr. Quest, who will act for me in the
      matter, will prepare a single deed charging the estate for the round
      total.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah yes, the plan seems a satisfactory one, but of course in so
      important a matter I should prefer to consult my legal adviser before
      giving a final answer, indeed I think that it would be better if the whole
      affair were carried out in a proper and formal way?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, surely, Mr. de la Molle,&rdquo; said the younger man with
      some irritation, for the old gentleman&rsquo;s somewhat magnificent manner
      rather annoyed him, which under the circumstances was not unnatural.
      &ldquo;Surely you do not want to consult a legal adviser to make up your
      mind as to whether or no you will allow a foreclosure. I offer you the
      money at four per cent. Cannot you let me have an answer now, yes or no?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like being hurried. I can&rsquo;t bear to be hurried,&rdquo;
      said the Squire pettishly. &ldquo;These important matters require
      consideration, a great deal of consideration. Still,&rdquo; he added,
      observing signs of increasing irritation upon Edward Cossey&rsquo;s face,
      and not having the slightest intention of throwing away the opportunity,
      though he would dearly have liked to prolong the negotiations for a week
      or two, if it was only to enjoy the illusory satisfaction of dabbling with
      such a large sum of money. &ldquo;Still, as you are so pressing about it,
      I really, speaking off hand, can see no objection to your taking up the
      mortgages on the terms you mention.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Mr. de la Molle. Now I have on my part one condition and
      one only to attach to this offer of mine, which is that my name is not
      mentioned in connection with it. I do not wish Cossey and Son to know that
      I have taken up this investment on my own account. In fact, so necessary
      to me is it that my name should not be mentioned, that if it does
      transpire before the affair is completed I shall withdraw my offer, and if
      it transpires afterwards I shall call the money in. The loan will be
      advanced by a client of Mr. Quest&rsquo;s. Is that understood between us?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum,&rdquo; said the Squire, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite like this
      secrecy about these matters of business, but still if you make a point of
      it, why of course I cannot object.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. Then I presume that you will write officially to Cossey
      and Son stating that the money will be forthcoming to meet their various
      charges and the overdue interest. And now I think that we have had about
      enough of this business for once, so with your permission I will pay my
      respects to Miss de la Molle before I go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said the Squire, pressing his hand to his head,
      &ldquo;you do hurry me so dreadfully&mdash;I really don&rsquo;t know where
      I am. Miss de la Molle is out; I saw her go out sketching myself. Sit down
      and we will talk this business over a little more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you, Mr. de la Molle, I have to talk about money every
      day of my life and I soon have enough of the subject. Quest will arrange
      all the details. Good-bye, don&rsquo;t bother to ring, I will find my
      horse.&rdquo; And with a shake of the hand he was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the old gentleman to himself when his visitor had
      departed, &ldquo;he asked for Ida, so I suppose that is what he is after.
      But it is a queer sort of way to begin courting, and if she finds it out I
      should think that it would go against him. Ida is not the sort of woman to
      be won by a money consideration. Well, she can very well look after
      herself, that&rsquo;s certain. Anyway it has been a good morning&rsquo;s
      work, but somehow I don&rsquo;t like that young man any the better for it.
      I have it&mdash;there&rsquo;s something wanting. He is not quite a
      gentleman. Well, I must find that fellow George,&rdquo; and he rushed to
      the front door and roared for &ldquo;George,&rdquo; till the whole place
      echoed and the pheasants crowed in the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while there came faint answering yells of &ldquo;Coming, Squire,
      coming,&rdquo; and in due course George&rsquo;s long form became visible,
      striding swiftly up the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said his master, who was in high good humour, &ldquo;did
      you find your man?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well no, Squire&mdash;that is, I had a rare hunt after him, and I
      had just happened of him up a tree when you began to halloa so loud, that
      he went nigh to falling out of it, so I had to tell him to come back next
      week, or the week after.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You happened of him up a tree. Why what the deuce was the man doing
      up a tree&mdash;measuring it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Squire, I don&rsquo;t rightly know what he wor after, but he is
      a curious kind of a chap, and he said he had a fancy to wait there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens! no wonder the place is going to ruin, when you deal
      with men who have a fancy to transact their business up a tree. Well,
      never mind that, I have settled the matter about the mortgages. Of course
      somebody, a client of Mr. Quest&rsquo;s, has been found without the least
      difficulty to take them up at four per cent. and advance the other five
      thousand too, so that there be no more anxiety about that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s a good job at any rate,&rdquo; answered George
      with a sigh of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good job? Of course it&rsquo;s a good job, but it is no more than
      I expected. It wasn&rsquo;t likely that such an eligible investment, as
      they say in the advertisements, would be allowed to go begging for long.
      But that&rsquo;s just the way with you; the moment there&rsquo;s a hitch
      you come with your long face and your uneducated sort of way, and swear
      that we are all ruined and that the country is breaking up, and that there&rsquo;s
      nothing before us but the workhouse, and nobody knows what.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      George reflected that the Squire had forgotten that not an hour before he
      himself had been vowing that they were ruined, while he, George, had
      stoutly sworn that something would turn up to help them. But his back was
      accustomed to those vicarious burdens, nor to tell the truth did they go
      nigh to the breaking of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a good job anyway, and I thank God Almighty for
      it,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and more especial since there&rsquo;ll be the
      money to take over the Moat Farm and give that varmint Janter the boot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give him <i>what?</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, kick him out, sir, for good and all, begging your pardon, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see. I do wish that you would respect the Queen&rsquo;s
      English a little more, George, and the name of the Creator too. By the way
      the parson was speaking to me again yesterday about your continued absence
      from church. It really is disgraceful; you are a most confirmed
      Sabbath-breaker. And now you mustn&rsquo;t waste my time here any longer.
      Go and look after your affairs. Stop a minute, would you like a glass of
      port?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, thank you, sir,&rdquo; said George reflectively, &ldquo;we
      hev had a lot of talk and I don&rsquo;t mind if I do, and as for that
      there parson, begging his pardon, I wish he would mind his own affairs and
      leave me to mind mine.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. &mdash; ABOUT ART
    </h2>
    <p>
      Edward Cossey drove from the Castle in a far from happy frame of mind. To
      begin with, the Squire and his condescending way of doing business
      irritated him very much, so much that once or twice in the course of the
      conversation he was within an ace of breaking the whole thing off, and
      only restrained himself with difficulty from doing so. As it was,
      notwithstanding all the sacrifices and money risks which he was undergoing
      to take up these mortgages, and they were very considerable even to a man
      of his great prospects, he felt that he had been placed in the position of
      a person who receives a favour rather than of a person who grants one.
      Moreover there was an assumption of superiority about the old man, a
      visible recognition of the gulf which used to be fixed between the
      gentleman of family and the man of business who has grown rich by trading
      in money and money&rsquo;s worth, which was the more galling because it
      was founded on actual fact, and Edward Cossey knew it. All his foibles and
      oddities notwithstanding, it would have been impossible for any person of
      discernment to entertain a comparison between the half-ruined Squire and
      the young banker, who would shortly be worth between half a million and a
      million sterling. The former was a representative, though a somewhat
      erratic one, of all that is best in the old type of Englishmen of gentle
      blood, which is now so rapidly vanishing, and of the class to which to a
      large extent this country owes her greatness. His very eccentricities were
      wandering lights that showed unsuspected heights and depths in his
      character&mdash;love of country and his country&rsquo;s honour, respect
      for the religion of his fathers, loyalty of mind and valour for the right.
      Had he lived in other times, like some of the old Boisseys and de la
      Molles, who were at Honham before him, he would probably have died in the
      Crusades or at Cressy, or perhaps more uselessly, for his King at Marston
      Moor, or like that last but one of the true de la Molles, kneeling in the
      courtyard of his Castle and defying his enemies to wring his secret from
      him. Now few such opportunities are left to men of his stamp, and they
      are, perhaps as a consequence, dying out of an age which is unsuited to
      them, and indeed to most strong growths of individual character. It would
      be much easier to deal with a gentleman like the Squire of this history if
      we could only reach down one of those suits of armour from the walls of
      his vestibule, and put it on his back, and take that long two-handled
      sword which last flashed on Flodden Field from its resting-place beneath
      the clock, and at the end see him die as a loyal knight should do in the
      forefront of his retainers, with the old war cry of &ldquo;<i>a Delamol&mdash;a
      Delamol</i>&rdquo; upon his lips. As it is, he is an aristocratic
      anachronism, an entity unfitted to deal with the elements of our advanced
      and in some ways emasculated age. His body should have been where his
      heart was&mdash;in the past. What chance have such as he against the
      Quests of this polite era of political economy and penny papers?
    </p>
    <p>
      No wonder that Edward Cossey felt his inferiority to this symbol and type
      of the things that no more are, yes even in the shadow of his thirty
      thousand pounds. For here we have a different breed. Goldsmiths two
      centuries ago, then bankers from generation to generation, money bees
      seeking for wealth and counting it and hiving it from decade to decade,
      till at last gold became to them what honour is to the nobler stock&mdash;the
      pervading principle, and the clink of the guinea and the rustling of the
      bank note stirred their blood as the clank of armed men and the sound of
      the flapping banner with its three golden hawks flaming in the sun, was
      wont to set the hearts of the race of Boissey, of Dofferleigh and of de la
      Molle, beating to that tune to which England marched on to win the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a foolish and vain thing to scoff at business and those who do it in
      the market places, and to shout out the old war cries of our fathers, in
      the face of a generation which sings the song of capital, or groans in
      heavy labour beneath the banners of their copyrighted trade marks; and
      besides, who would buy our books (also copyrighted except in America) if
      we did? Let us rather rise up and clothe ourselves, and put a tall hat
      upon our heads and do homage to the new Democracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet in the depths of our hearts and the quiet of our chambers let us
      sometimes cry to the old days, and the old men, and the old ways of
      thought, let us cry &ldquo;<i>Ave atque vale</i>,&mdash;Hail and farewell.&rdquo;
      Our fathers&rsquo; armour hangs above the door, their portraits decorate
      the wall, and their fierce and half-tamed hearts moulder beneath the
      stones of yonder church. Hail and farewell to you, our fathers! Perchance
      a man might have had worse company than he met with at your boards, and
      even have found it not more hard to die beneath your sword-cuts than to be
      gently cozened to the grave by duly qualified practitioners at two guineas
      a visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the upshot of all this is that the Squire was not altogether wrong
      when he declared in the silence of <i>his</i> chamber that Edward Cossey
      was not quite a gentleman. He showed it when he allowed himself to be
      guided by the arts of Mr. Quest into the adoption of the idea of obtaining
      a lien upon Ida, to be enforced if convenient. He showed it again, and
      what is more he committed a huge mistake, when tempted thereto by the
      opportunity of the moment, he made a conditional bargain with the said
      Ida, whereby she was placed in pledge for a sum of thirty thousand pounds,
      well knowing that her honour would be equal to the test, and that if
      convenient to him she would be ready to pay the debt. He made a huge
      mistake, for had he been quite a gentleman, he would have known that he
      could not have adopted a worse road to the affections of a lady. Had he
      been content to advance the money and then by-and-bye, though even that
      would not have been gentlemanlike, have gently let transpire what he had
      done at great personal expense and inconvenience, her imagination might
      have been touched and her gratitude would certainly have been excited. But
      the idea of bargaining, the idea of purchase, which after what had passed
      could never be put aside, would of necessity be fatal to any hope of
      tender feeling. Shylock might get his bond, but of his own act he had
      debarred himself from the possibility of ever getting more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Edward Cossey was not lacking in that afterglow of refinement which is
      left by a course of public school and university education. No education
      can make a gentleman of a man who is not a gentleman at heart, for whether
      his station in life be that of a ploughboy or an Earl, the gentleman, like
      the poet, is born and not made. But it can and does if he be of an
      observant nature, give him a certain insight into the habits of thought
      and probable course of action of the members of that class to which he
      outwardly, and by repute, belongs. Such an insight Edward Cossey
      possessed, and at the present moment its possession was troubling him very
      much. His trading instincts, the desire bred in him to get something for
      his money, had led him to make the bargain, but now that it was done his
      better judgment rose up against it. For the truth may as well be told at
      once, although he would as yet scarcely acknowledge it to himself, Edward
      Cossey was already violently enamoured of Ida. He was by nature a
      passionate man, and as it chanced she had proved the magnet with power to
      draw his passion. But as the reader is aware, there existed another
      complication in his life for which he was not perhaps entirely
      responsible. When still quite a youth in mind, he had suddenly found
      himself the object of the love of a beautiful and enthralling woman, and
      had after a more or less severe struggle yielded to the temptation, as,
      out of a book, many young men would have done. Now to be the object of the
      violent affection of such a woman as Belle Quest is no doubt very
      flattering and even charming for a while. But if that affection is not
      returned in kind, if in short the gentleman does not love the lady quite
      as warmly as she loves him, then in course of time the charm is apt to
      vanish and even the flattery to cease to give pleasure. Also, when as in
      the present case the connection is wrong in itself and universally
      condemned by society, the affection which can still triumph and endure on
      both sides must be of a very strong and lasting order. Even an
      unprincipled man dislikes the acting of one long lie such as an intimacy
      of the sort necessarily involves, and if the man happens to be rather weak
      than unprincipled, the dislike is apt to turn to loathing, some portion of
      which will certainly be reflected on to the partner of his ill-doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are general principles, but the case of Edward Cossey offered no
      exception to them, indeed it illustrated them well. He had never been in
      love with Mrs. Quest; to begin with she had shown herself too much in love
      with him to necessitate any display of emotion on his part. Her violent
      and unreasoning passion wearied and alarmed him, he never knew what she
      would do next and was kept in a continual condition of anxiety and
      irritation as to what the morrow might bring forth. Too sure of her
      unaltering attachment to have any pretext for jealousy, he found it
      exceedingly irksome to be obliged to avoid giving cause for it on his
      side, which, however, he dreaded doing lest he should thereby bring about
      some overwhelming catastrophe. Mrs. Quest was, as he well knew, not a
      woman who would pause to consider consequences if once her passionate
      jealousy were really aroused. It was even doubtful if the certainty of her
      own ruin would check her. Her love was everything to her, it was her life,
      the thing she lived for, and rather than tamely lose it, it seemed
      extremely probable to Edward Cossey that she would not hesitate to face
      shame, or even death. Indeed it was through this great passion of hers,
      and through it only, that he could hope to influence her. If he could
      persuade her to release him, by pointing out that a continuance of the
      intrigue must involve him in ruin of some sort, all might yet go well with
      him. If not his future was a dark one.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the state of affairs before he became attached to Ida de la
      Molle, after which the horizon grew blacker than ever. At first he tried
      to get out of the difficulty by avoiding Ida, but it did not answer. She
      exercised an irresistible attraction over him. Her calm and stately
      presence was to him what the sight of mountain snows is to one scorched by
      continual heat. He was weary of passionate outbursts, tears, agonies,
      alarms, presentiments, and all the paraphernalia of secret love. It
      appeared to him, looking up at the beautiful snow, that if once he could
      reach it life would be all sweetness and light, that there would be no
      more thirst, no more fear, and no more forced marches through those
      ill-odoured quagmires of deceit. The more he allowed his imagination to
      dwell upon the picture, the fiercer grew his longing to possess it. Also,
      he knew well enough that to marry a woman like Ida de la Molle would be
      the greatest blessing that could happen to him, for she would of necessity
      lift him up above himself. She had little money it was true, but that was
      a very minor matter to him, and she had birth and breeding and beauty, and
      a presence which commands homage. And so it came to pass that he fell
      deeply and yet more deeply in love with Ida, and that as he did so his
      connection with Mrs. Quest (although we have seen him but yesterday
      offering in a passing fit of tenderness and remorse to run away with her)
      became more and more irksome to him. And now, as he drove leisurely back
      to Boisingham, he felt that he had imperilled all his hopes by a rash
      indulgence in his trading instincts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the road took a turn and a sight was revealed that did not tend
      to improve his already irritable mood. Just here the roadway was bordered
      by a deep bank covered with trees which sloped down to the valley of the
      Ell, at this time of the year looking its loveliest in the soft autumn
      lights. And here, seated on a bank of turf beneath the shadow of a
      yellowing chestnut tree, in such position as to get a view of the green
      valley and flashing river where cattle red and white stood chewing the
      still luxuriant aftermath, was none other than Ida herself, and what was
      more, Ida accompanied by Colonel Quaritch. They were seated on campstools,
      and in front of each of them was an easel. Clearly they were painting
      together, for as Edward gazed, the Colonel rose, came up close behind his
      companion&rsquo;s stool made a ring of his thumb and first finger, gazed
      critically through it at the lady&rsquo;s performance, then sadly shook
      his head and made some remark. Thereupon Ida turned round and began an
      animated discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang me,&rdquo; said Edward to himself, &ldquo;if she has not taken
      up with that confounded old military frump. Painting together! Ah, I know
      what that means. Well, I should have thought that if there was one man
      more than another whom she would have disliked, it would have been that
      battered-looking Colonel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He pulled up his horse and reflected for a moment, then handing the reins
      to his servant, jumped out, and climbing through a gap in the fence walked
      up to the tree. So engrossed were they in their argument, that they
      neither saw nor heard him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nonsense, Colonel Quaritch, perfect nonsense, if you
      will forgive me for telling you so,&rdquo; Ida was saying with warmth.
      &ldquo;It is all very well for you to complain that my trees are a blur,
      and the castle nothing but a splotch, but I am looking at the water, and
      if I am looking at the water, it is quite impossible that I should see the
      trees and the cows otherwise than I have rendered them on the canvas. True
      art is to paint what the painter sees and as he sees it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Quaritch shook his head and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cant of the impressionist school,&rdquo; he said sadly; &ldquo;on
      the contrary, the business of the artist is to paint what he knows to be
      there,&rdquo; and he gazed complacently at his own canvas, which had the
      appearance of a spirited drawing of a fortified place, or of the contents
      of a child&rsquo;s Noah&rsquo;s ark, so stiff, so solid, so formidable
      were its outlines, trees and animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida shrugged her shoulders, laughed merrily, and turned round to find
      herself face to face with Edward Cossey. She started back, and her
      expression hardened&mdash;then she stretched out her hand and said,
      &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; in her very coldest tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Miss de la Molle?&rdquo; he said, assuming as
      unconcerned an air as he could, and bowing stiffly to Harold Quaritch, who
      returned the bow and went back to his canvas, which was placed a few paces
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw you painting,&rdquo; went on Edward Cossey in a low tone,
      &ldquo;so I thought I would come and tell you that I have settled the
      matter with Mr. de la Molle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, indeed,&rdquo; answered Ida, hitting viciously at a wasp with
      her paint brush. &ldquo;Well, I hope that you will find the investment a
      satisfactory one. And now, if you please, do not let us talk any more
      about money, because I am quite tired of the subject.&rdquo; Then raising
      her voice she went on, &ldquo;Come here, Colonel Quaritch, and Mr. Cossey
      shall judge between us,&rdquo; and she pointed to her picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward glanced at the Colonel with no amiable air. &ldquo;I know nothing
      about art,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I am afraid that I must be getting
      on. Good-morning,&rdquo; and taking off his hat to Ida, he turned and
      went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Umph,&rdquo; said the Colonel, looking after him with a quizzical
      expression, &ldquo;that gentleman seems rather short in his temper. Wants
      knocking about the world a bit, I should say. But I beg your pardon, I
      suppose that he is a friend of yours, Miss de la Molle?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is an acquaintance of mine,&rdquo; answered Ida with emphasis.

      CHAPTER XIV. &mdash; THE TIGER SHOWS HER CLAWS
    </h2>
    <p>
      After this very chilling reception at the hands of the object of his
      affection, Edward Cossey continued his drive in an even worse temper than
      before. He reached his rooms, had some luncheon, and then in pursuance of
      a previous engagement went over to the Oaks to see Mrs. Quest.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found her waiting for him in the drawing-room. She was standing at the
      window with her hands behind her, a favourite attitude of hers. As soon as
      the door was shut, she turned, came up to him, and grasped his hand
      affectionately between her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is an age since I have seen you, Edward,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;one whole day. Really, when I do not see you, I do not live, I only
      exist.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He freed himself from her clasp with a quick movement. &ldquo;Really,
      Belle,&rdquo; he said impatiently, &ldquo;you might be a little more
      careful than to go through that performance in front of an open window&mdash;especially
      as the gardener must have seen the whole thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t much care if he did,&rdquo; she said defiantly.
      &ldquo;What does it matter? My husband is certainly not in a position to
      make a fuss about other people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it matter?&rdquo; he said, stamping his foot. &ldquo;What
      does it <i>not</i> matter? If you have no care for your good name, do you
      suppose that I am indifferent to mine?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Quest opened her large violet eyes to the fullest extent, and a
      curious light was reflected from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have grown wonderfully cautious all of a sudden, Edward,&rdquo;
      she said meaningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the use of my being cautious when you are so reckless? I
      tell you what it is, Belle. We are talked of all over this gossiping town,
      and I don&rsquo;t like it, and what is more, once and for all, I won&rsquo;t
      have it. If you will not be more careful, I will break with you
      altogether, and that is the long and short of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you been this morning?&rdquo; she asked in the same
      ominously calm voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been to Honham Castle on a matter of business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, and yesterday you were there on a matter of pleasure. Now did
      you happen to see Ida in the course of your business?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, looking her full in the face, &ldquo;I did
      see her, what about it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By appointment, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not by appointment. Have you done your catechism?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;and now I am going to preach a homily on it. I see
      through you perfectly, Edward. You are getting tired of me, and you want
      to be rid of me. I tell you plainly that you are not going the right way
      to work about it. No woman, especially if she be in my&mdash;unfortunate
      position, can tamely bear to see herself discarded for another. Certainly
      I cannot&mdash;and I caution you&mdash;I caution you to be careful,
      because when I think of such a thing I am not quite myself,&rdquo; and
      suddenly, without the slightest warning (for her face had been hard and
      cold as stone), she burst into a flood of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Edward Cossey was naturally somewhat moved at this sight. Of course he
      did his best to console her, though with no great results, for she was
      still sobbing bitterly when suddenly there came a knock at the door. Mrs.
      Quest turned her face towards the wall and pretended to be reading a
      letter, and he tried to look as unconcerned as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A telegram for you, sir,&rdquo; said the girl with a sharp glance
      at her mistress. &ldquo;The telegraph boy brought it on here, when he
      heard that you were not at home, because he said he would be sure to find
      you here&mdash;and please, sir, he hopes that you will give him sixpence
      for bringing it round, as he thought it might be important.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward felt in his pocket and gave the girl a shilling, telling her to say
      that there was no answer. As soon as she had gone, he opened the telegram.
      It was from his sister in London, and ran as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come up to town at once. Father has had a stroke of paralysis.
      Shall expect you by the seven o&rsquo;clock train.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Mrs. Quest, noting the alarm on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, my father is very ill. He has had a stroke of paralysis, and I
      must go to town by the next train.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you be long away?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know. How can I tell? Good-bye, Belle. I am sorry that we
      should have had this scene just as I am going, but I can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Edward,&rdquo; she said, catching him by the arm and turning
      her tear-stained face up towards his own, &ldquo;you are not angry with
      me, are you? Do not let us part in anger. How can I help being jealous
      when I love you so? Tell me that you do not hate me&mdash;or I shall be
      wretched all the time that you are away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, of course not&mdash;but I must say, I wish that you would
      not make such shocking scenes&mdash;good-bye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; she answered as she gave him her shaking hand.
      &ldquo;Good-bye, my dear. If only you knew what I feel here,&rdquo; she
      pointed to her breast, &ldquo;you would make excuses for me.&rdquo; Almost
      before she had finished her sentence he was gone. She stood near the door,
      listening to his retreating footsteps till they had quite died away, and
      then flung herself in the chair and rested her head upon her hands.
      &ldquo;I shall lose him,&rdquo; she said to herself in the bitterness of
      her heart. &ldquo;I know I shall. What chance have I against her? He
      already cares for Ida a great deal more than he does for me, in the end he
      will break from me and marry her. Oh, I had rather see him dead&mdash;and
      myself too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-an-hour later, Mr. Quest came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Cossey?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Cossey&rsquo;s father has had a stroke of paralysis and he has
      gone up to London to look after him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Mr. Quest. &ldquo;Well, if the old gentleman dies,
      your friend will be one of the wealthiest men in England.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so much the better for him. I am sure money is a great
      blessing. It protects one from so much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Quest with emphasis, &ldquo;so much the better
      for him, and all connected with him. Why have you been crying? Because
      Cossey has gone away&mdash;or have you quarrelled with him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that I have been crying? If I have, it&rsquo;s my
      affair. At any rate my tears are my own.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, they are&mdash;I do not wish to interfere with your
      crying&mdash;cry when you like. It will be lucky for Cossey if that old
      father of his dies just now, because he wants money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he want money for?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he has undertaken to pay off the mortgages on the Castle
      estates.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why has he done that, as an investment?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is a rotten investment. I believe that he has done it
      because he is in love with Miss de la Molle, and is naturally anxious to
      ingratiate himself with her. Don&rsquo;t you know that? I thought perhaps
      that was what you had been crying about?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not true,&rdquo; she answered, her lips quivering with pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Quest laughed gently. &ldquo;I think you must have lost your power of
      observation, which used to be sufficiently keen. However, of course it
      does not matter to you. It will in many ways be a most suitable marriage,
      and I am sure they will make a very handsome couple.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She made no answer, and turned her back to hide the workings of her face.
      For a few moments her husband stood looking at her, a gentle smile playing
      on his refined features. Then remarking that he must go round to the
      office, but would be back in time for tea, he went, reflecting with
      satisfaction that he had given his wife something to think about which
      would scarcely be to her taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Belle Quest, she waited till the door had closed, and then turned
      round towards it and spoke aloud, as though she were addressing her
      vanished husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate you,&rdquo; she said, with bitter emphasis. &ldquo;I hate
      you. You have ruined my life, and now you torment me as though I were a
      lost soul. Oh, I wish I were dead! I wish I were dead!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching his office, Mr. Quest found two letters for him, one of which
      had just arrived by the afternoon post. The first was addressed in the
      Squire&rsquo;s handwriting and signed with his big seal, and the other
      bore a superscription, the sight of which made him turn momentarily faint.
      Taking up this last with a visible effort, he opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was from the &ldquo;Tiger,&rdquo; alias Edith, and its coarse contents
      need not be written here. Put shortly they came to this. She was being
      summoned for debt. She wanted more money and would have it. If five
      hundred pounds were not forthcoming and that shortly&mdash;within a week,
      indeed&mdash;she threatened with no uncertain voice to journey down to
      Boisingham and put him to an open shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this woman will destroy me.
      What a devil! And she&rsquo;d be as good as her word unless I found her
      the money. I must go up to town at once. I wonder how she got that idea
      into her head. It makes me shudder to think of her in Boisingham,&rdquo;
      and he dropped his face upon his hands and groaned in the bitterness of
      his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is hard,&rdquo; he thought to himself; &ldquo;here have I for
      years and years been striving and toiling, labouring to become a
      respectable and respected member of society, but always this old folly
      haunts my steps and drags me down, and by heaven I believe that it will
      destroy me after all.&rdquo; With a sigh he lifted his head, and taking a
      sheet of paper wrote on it, &ldquo;I have received your letter, and will
      come and see you to-morrow or the next day.&rdquo; This note he placed in
      an envelope, which he directed to the high-sounding name of Mrs. d&rsquo;Aubigne,
      Rupert St., Pimlico&mdash;and put it in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then with another sigh he took up the Squire&rsquo;s letter, and glanced
      through it. Its length was considerable, but in substance it announced his
      acceptance of the arrangement proposed by Mr. Edward Cossey, and requested
      that he would prepare the necessary deeds to be submitted to his lawyers.
      Mr. Quest read the letter absently enough, and threw it down with a little
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a queer world it is,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;and
      what a ludicrous side there is to it all. Here is Cossey advancing money
      to get a hold over Ida de la Molle, whom he means to marry if he can, and
      who is probably playing her own hand. Here is Belle madly in love with
      Cossey, who will break her heart. Here am I loving Belle, who hates me,
      and playing everybody&rsquo;s game in order to advance my own, and become
      a respected member of a society I am superior to. Here is the Squire
      blundering about like a walrus in a horse-pond, and fancying everything is
      being conducted for his sole advantage, and that all the world revolves
      round Honham Castle. And there at the end of the chain is this female
      harpy, Edith Jones, otherwise d&rsquo;Aubigne, alias the Tiger, gnawing at
      my vitals and holding my fortunes in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! it&rsquo;s a queer world and full of combinations, but the
      worst of it is that plot as we will the solution of them does not rest
      with us, no &mdash;not with us.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. &mdash; THE HAPPY DAYS
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is a troublesome world enough, but thanks to that mitigating fate
      which now and again interferes to our advantage, there do come to most of
      us times and periods of existence which, if they do not quite fulfil all
      the conditions of ideal happiness, yet go near enough to that end to
      permit in after days of our imagining that they did so. I say to most of
      us, but in doing so I allude chiefly to those classes commonly known as
      the &ldquo;upper,&rdquo; by which is understood those who have enough
      bread to put into their mouths and clothes to warm them; those, too, who
      are not the present subjects of remorseless and hideous ailments, who are
      not daily agonised by the sight of their famished offspring; who are not
      doomed to beat out their lives against the madhouse bars, or to see their
      hearts&rsquo; beloved and their most cherished hope wither towards that
      cold space from whence no message comes. For such unfortunates, and for
      their million-numbered kin upon the globe&mdash;the victims of war,
      famine, slave trade, oppression, usury, over-population, and the curse of
      competition, the rays of light must be few indeed; few and far between,
      only just enough to save them from utter hopelessness. And even to the
      favoured ones, the well warmed and well fed, who are to a great extent
      lifted by fortune or by their native strength and wit above the
      degradations of the world, this light of happiness is but as the gleam of
      stars, uncertain, fitful, and continually lost in clouds. Only the utterly
      selfish or the utterly ignorant can be happy with the happiness of savages
      or children, however prosperous their own affairs, for to the rest, to
      those who think and have hearts to feel, and imagination to realise, and a
      redeeming human sympathy to be touched, the mere weight of the world&rsquo;s
      misery pressing round them like an atmosphere, the mere echoes of the
      groans of the dying and the cries of the children are sufficient, and more
      than sufficient, to dull, aye, to destroy the promise of their joys. But,
      even to this finer sort there do come rare periods of almost complete
      happiness&mdash;little summers in the tempestuous climate of our years,
      green-fringed wells of water in our desert, pure northern lights breaking
      in upon our gloom. And strange as it may seem, these breadths of happy
      days, when the old questions cease to torment, and a man can trust in
      Providence and without one qualifying thought bless the day that he was
      born, are very frequently connected with the passion which is known as
      love; that mysterious symbol of our double nature, that strange tree of
      life which, with its roots sucking their strength from the dust-heap of
      humanity, yet springs aloft above our level and bears its blooms in the
      face of heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why it is and what it means we shall perhaps never know for certain. But
      it does suggest itself, that as the greatest terror of our being lies in
      the utter loneliness, the unspeakable identity, and unchanging
      self-completeness of every living creature, so the greatest hope and the
      intensest natural yearning of our hearts go out towards that passion which
      in its fire heats has the strength, if only for a little while, to melt
      down the barriers of our individuality and give to the soul something of
      the power for which it yearns of losing its sense of solitude in converse
      with its kind. For alone we are from infancy to death!&mdash;we, for the
      most part, grow not more near together but rather wider apart with the
      widening years. Where go the sympathies between the parent and the child,
      and where is the close old love of brother for his brother?
    </p>
    <p>
      The invisible fates are continually wrapping us round and round with the
      winding sheets of our solitude, and none may know all our heart save He
      who made it. We are set upon the world as the stars are set upon the sky,
      and though in following our fated orbits we pass and repass, and each
      shine out on each, yet are we the same lonely lights, rolling obedient to
      laws we cannot understand, through spaces of which none may mark the
      measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only, as says the poet in words of truth and beauty:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Only but this is rare&mdash;
          When a beloved hand is laid in ours,
          When jaded with the rush and glare
          Of the interminable hours,
          Our eyes can in another&rsquo;s eyes read clear;
          When our world-deafened ear
          Is by the tones of a loved voice caressed
          A bolt is shot back somewhere in our breast
          And a lost pulse of feeling stirs again&mdash;
          And what we mean we say and what we would we know.

</pre>
    <hr />
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          And then he thinks he knows
          The hills where his life rose
          And the sea whereunto it goes.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Some such Indian summer of delight and forgetfulness of trouble, and the
      tragic condition of our days, was now opening to Harold Quaritch and Ida
      de la Molle. Every day, or almost every day, they met and went upon their
      painting expeditions and argued the point of the validity or otherwise of
      the impressionist doctrines of art. Not that of all this painting came
      anything very wonderful, although in the evening the Colonel would take
      out his canvases and contemplate their rigid proportions with singular
      pride and satisfaction. It was a little weakness of his to think that he
      could paint, and one of which he was somewhat tenacious. Like many another
      man he could do a number of things exceedingly well and one thing very
      badly, and yet had more faith in that bad thing than in all the good.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, strange to say, although he affected to believe so firmly in his own
      style of art and hold Ida&rsquo;s in such cheap regard, it was a little
      painting of the latter&rsquo;s that he valued most, and which was oftenest
      put upon his easel for purposes of solitary admiration. It was one of
      those very impressionist productions that faded away in the distance, and
      full of soft grey tints, such as his soul loathed. There was a tree with a
      blot of brown colour on it, and altogether (though as a matter of fact a
      clever thing enough) from his point of view of art it was utterly &ldquo;anathema.&rdquo;
      This little picture in oils faintly shadowed out himself sitting at his
      easel, working in the soft grey of the autumn evening, and Ida had painted
      it and given it to him, and that was why he admired it so much. For to
      speak the truth, our friend the Colonel was going, going fast&mdash;sinking
      out of sight of his former self into the depths of the love that possessed
      his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a very simple and pure-minded man. Strange as it may appear, since
      that first unhappy business of his youth, of which he had never been heard
      to speak, no living woman had been anything to him. Therefore, instead of
      becoming further vulgarised and hardened by association with all the odds
      and ends of womankind that a man travelling about the globe comes into
      contact with, generally not greatly to his improvement, his faith had
      found time to grow up stronger even than at first. Once more he looked
      upon woman as a young man looks before he has had bitter experience of the
      world&mdash;as a being to be venerated and almost worshipped, as something
      better, brighter, purer than himself, hardly to be won, and when won to be
      worn like a jewel prized at once for value and for beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this is a dangerous state of mind for a man of three or four and forty
      to fall into, because it is a soft state, and this is a world in which the
      softest are apt to get the worst of it. At four and forty a man, of
      course, should be hard enough to get the better of other people, as indeed
      he generally is.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Harold Quaritch, after that long interval, set his eyes again upon
      Ida&rsquo;s face, he felt a curious change come over him. All the vague
      ideas and more or less poetical aspirations which for five long years had
      gathered themselves about that memory, took shape and form, and in his
      heart he knew he loved her. Then as the days went on and he came to know
      her better, he grew to love her more and more, till at last his whole
      heart went out towards his late found treasure, and she became more than
      life to him, more than aught else had been or could be. Serene and happy
      were those days which they spent in painting and talking as they wandered
      about the Honham Castle grounds. By degrees Ida&rsquo;s slight but
      perceptible hardness of manner wore away, and she stood out what she was,
      one of the sweetest and most natural women in England, and with it all, a
      woman having brains and force of character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon Harold discovered that her life had been anything but an easy one.
      The constant anxiety about money and her father&rsquo;s affairs had worn
      her down and hardened her till, as she said, she began to feel as though
      she had no heart left. Then too he heard all her trouble about her dead
      and only brother James, how dearly she had loved him, and what a sore
      trouble he had been with his extravagant ways and his continual demands
      for money, which had to be met somehow or other. At last came the crushing
      blow of his death, and with it the certainty of the extinction of the male
      line of the de la Molles, and she said that for a while she had believed
      her father would never hold up his head again. But his vitality was equal
      to the shock, and after a time the debts began to come in, which although
      he was not legally bound to do so, her father would insist upon meeting to
      the last farthing for the honour of the family and out of respect for his
      son&rsquo;s memory. This increased their money troubles, which had gone on
      and on, always getting worse as the agricultural depression deepened, till
      things had reached their present position.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this she told him bit by bit, only keeping back from him the last
      development of the drama with the part that Edward Cossey had played in
      it, and sad enough it made him to think of that ancient house of de la
      Molle vanishing into the night of ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also she told him something of her own life, how companionless it had been
      since her brother went into the army, for she had no real friends about
      Honham, and not even an acquaintance of her own tastes, which, without
      being gushingly so, were decidedly artistic and intellectual. &ldquo;I
      should have wished,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to try to do something in the
      world. I daresay I should have failed, for I know that very few women meet
      with a success which is worth having. But still I should have liked to
      try, for I am not afraid of work. But the current of my life is against
      it; the only thing that is open to me is to strive and make both ends meet
      upon an income which is always growing smaller, and to save my father,
      poor dear, from as much worry as I can.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think that I am complaining,&rdquo; she went on
      hurriedly, &ldquo;or that I want to rush into pleasure-seeking, because I
      do not&mdash;a little of that goes a long way with me. Besides, I know
      that I have many things to be thankful for. Few women have such a kind
      father as mine, though we do quarrel at times. Of course we cannot have
      everything our own way in this world, and I daresay that I do not make the
      best of things. Still, at times it does seem a little hard that I should
      be forced to lead such a narrow life, just when I feel that I could work
      in a wide one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold looked up at her face and saw that a tear was gathering in her dark
      eyes and in his heart he registered a vow that if by any means it ever lay
      within his power to improve her lot he would give everything he had to do
      it. But all he said was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be downhearted, Miss de la Molle. Things change in a
      wonderful way, and often they mend when they look worst. You know,&rdquo;
      he went on a little nervously, &ldquo;I am an old-fashioned sort of
      individual, and I believe in Providence and all that sort of thing, you
      see, and that matters generally come pretty well straight in the long run
      if people deserve it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida shook her head a little doubtfully and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I suppose that we do not
      deserve it. Anyhow, our good fortune is a long while coming,&rdquo; and
      the conversation dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still her friend&rsquo;s strong belief in the efficacy of Providence, and
      generally his masculine sturdiness, did cheer her up considerably. Even
      the strongest women, if they have any element that can be called feminine
      left in them, want somebody of the other sex to lean on, and she was no
      exception to the rule. Besides, if Ida&rsquo;s society had charms for
      Colonel Quaritch, his society had almost if not quite as much charm for
      her. It may be remembered that on the night when they first met she had
      spoken to herself of him as the kind of man whom she would like to marry.
      The thought was a passing one, and it may be safely said that she had not
      since entertained any serious idea of marriage in connection with Colonel
      Quaritch. The only person whom there seemed to be the slightest
      probability of her marrying was Edward Cossey, and the mere thought of
      this was enough to make the whole idea of matrimony repugnant to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this notwithstanding, day by day she found Harold Quaritch&rsquo;s
      society more congenial. Herself by nature, and also to a certain degree by
      education, a cultured woman, she rejoiced to find in him an entirely
      kindred spirit. For beneath his somewhat rugged and unpromising exterior,
      Harold Quaritch hid a vein of considerable richness. Few of those who
      associated with him would have believed that the man had a side to his
      nature which was almost poetic, or that he was a ripe and finished
      scholar, and, what is more, not devoid of a certain dry humour. Then he
      had travelled far and seen much of men and manners, gathering up all sorts
      of quaint odds and ends of information. But perhaps rather than these
      accomplishments it was the man&rsquo;s transparent honesty and
      simple-mindedness, his love for what is true and noble, and his contempt
      of what is mean and base, which, unwittingly peeping out through his
      conversation, attracted her more than all the rest. Ida was no more a
      young girl, to be caught by a handsome face or dazzled by a superficial
      show of mind. She was a thoughtful, ripened woman, quick to perceive, and
      with the rare talent of judgment wherewith to weigh the proceeds of her
      perception. In plain, middle-aged Colonel Quaritch she found a very
      perfect gentleman, and valued him accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so day grew into day through that lovely autumn-tide. Edward Cossey
      was away in London, Quest had ceased from troubling, and journeying
      together through the sweet shadows of companionship, by slow but sure
      degrees they drew near to the sunlit plain of love. For it is not common,
      indeed, it is so uncommon as to be almost impossible, that a man and woman
      between whom there stands no natural impediment can halt for very long in
      those shadowed ways. There is throughout all nature an impulse that pushes
      ever onwards towards completion, and from completion to fruition. Liking
      leads to sympathy, sympathy points the path to love, and then love demands
      its own. This is the order of affairs, and down its well-trodden road
      these two were quickly travelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      George the wily saw it, and winked his eye with solemn meaning. The Squire
      also saw something of it, not being wanting in knowledge of the world, and
      after much cogitation and many solitary walks elected to leave matters
      alone for the present. He liked Colonel Quaritch, and thought that it
      would be a good thing for Ida to get married, though the idea of parting
      from her troubled his heart sorely. Whether or no it would be desirable
      from his point of view that she should marry the Colonel was a matter on
      which he had not as yet fully made up his mind. Sometimes he thought it
      would, and sometimes he thought the reverse. Then at times vague ideas
      suggested by Edward Cossey&rsquo;s behaviour about the loan would come to
      puzzle him. But at present he was so much in the dark that he could come
      to no absolute decision, so with unaccustomed wisdom for so headstrong and
      precipitate a man, he determined to refrain from interference, and for a
      while at any rate allow events to take their natural course.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. &mdash; THE HOUSE WITH THE RED PILLARS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two days after his receipt of the second letter from the &ldquo;Tiger,&rdquo;
      Mr. Quest announced to his wife that he was going to London on business
      connected with the bank, and expected to be away for a couple of nights.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed straight out. &ldquo;Really, William,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you
      are a most consummate actor. I wonder that you think it worth while to
      keep up the farce with me. Well, I hope that Edith is not going to be very
      expensive this time, because we don&rsquo;t seem to be too rich just now,
      and you see there is no more of my money for her to have.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Quest winced visibly beneath this bitter satire, which his wife
      uttered with a smile of infantile innocence playing upon her face, but he
      made no reply. She knew too much. Only in his heart he wondered what fate
      she would mete out to him if ever she got possession of the whole truth,
      and the thought made him tremble. It seemed to him that the owner of that
      baby face could be terribly merciless in her vengeance, and that those
      soft white hands would close round the throat of a man she hated and
      utterly destroy him. Now, if never before, he realised that between him
      and this woman there must be enmity and a struggle to the death; and yet
      strangely enough he still loved her!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Quest reached London about three o&rsquo;clock, and his first act was
      to drive to Cossey and Son&rsquo;s, where he was informed that old Mr.
      Cossey was much better, and having heard that he was coming to town had
      sent to say that he particularly wished to see him, especially about the
      Honham Castle estates. Accordingly Mr. Quest drove on to the old gentleman&rsquo;s
      mansion in Grosvenor Street, where he asked for Mr. Edward Cossey. The
      footman said that Mr. Edward was upstairs, and showed him to a study while
      he went to tell him of the arrival of his visitor. Mr. Quest glanced round
      the luxuriously-furnished room, which he saw was occupied by Edward
      himself, for some letters directed in his handwriting lay upon the desk,
      and a velveteen lounging coat that Mr. Quest recognised as belonging to
      him was hanging over the back of a chair. Mr. Quest&rsquo;s eye wandering
      over this coat, was presently caught by the corner of a torn flap of an
      envelope which projected from one of the pockets. It was of a peculiar
      bluish tinge, in fact of a hue much affected by his wife. Listening for a
      moment to hear if anybody was coming, he stepped to the coat and extracted
      the letter. It <i>was</i> in his wife&rsquo;s handwriting, so he took the
      liberty of hastily transferring it to his own pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another minute Edward Cossey entered, and the two men shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Quest?&rdquo; said Edward. &ldquo;I think that the
      old man is going to pull through this bout. He is helpless but keen as a
      knife, and has all the important matters from the bank referred to him. I
      believe that he will last a year yet, but he will scarcely allow me out of
      his sight. He preaches away about business the whole day long and says
      that he wants to communicate the fruits of his experience to me before it
      is too late. He wishes to see you, so if you will you had better come up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly they went upstairs to a large and luxurious bedroom on the
      first floor, where the stricken man lay upon a patent couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Quest and Edward Cossey entered, a lady, old Mr. Cossey&rsquo;s
      eldest daughter, put down a paper out of which she had been reading the
      money article aloud, and, rising, informed her father that Mr. Quest had
      come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Quest?&rdquo; said the old man in a high thin voice. &ldquo;Ah,
      yes, I want to see Mr. Quest very much. Go away now, Anna, you can come
      back by-and-by, business before pleasure&mdash;most instructive, though,
      that sudden fall in American railways. But I thought it would come and I
      got Cossey&rsquo;s clear of them,&rdquo; and he sniffed with satisfaction
      and looked as though he would have rubbed his hands if he had not been
      physically incapacitated from so doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Quest came forward to where the invalid lay. He was a gaunt old man
      with white hair and a pallid face, which looked almost ghastly in contrast
      to his black velvet skull cap. So far as Mr. Quest could see, he appeared
      to be almost totally paralysed, with the exception of his head, neck, and
      left arm, which he could still move a little. His black eyes, however,
      were full of life and intelligence, and roamed about the room without
      ceasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Quest?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;sorry that I can&rsquo;t
      shake hands with you but you see I have been stricken down, though my
      brain is clear enough, clearer than ever it was, I think. And I ain&rsquo;t
      going to die yet&mdash;don&rsquo;t think that I am, because I ain&rsquo;t.
      I may live two years more&mdash;the doctor says I am sure to live one at
      least. A lot of money can be made in a year if you keep your eyes open.
      Once I made a hundred and twenty thousand for Cossey&rsquo;s in one year;
      and I may do it again before I die. I may make a lot of money yet, ah, a
      lot of money!&rdquo; and his voice went off into a thin scream that was
      not pleasant to listen to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I hope you will, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Quest politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you; take that for good luck, you know. Well, well, Mr.
      Quest, things haven&rsquo;t done so bad down in your part of the world;
      not at all bad considering the times. I thought we should have had to sell
      that old de la Molle up, but I hear that he is going to pay us off. Can&rsquo;t
      imagine who has been fool enough to lend him the money. A client of yours,
      eh? Well, he&rsquo;ll lose it I expect, and serve him right for his pains.
      But I am not sorry, for it is unpleasant for a house like ours to have to
      sell an old client up. Not that his account is worth much, nothing at all&mdash;more
      trouble than profit&mdash;or we should not have done it. He&rsquo;s no
      better than a bankrupt and the insolvency court is the best place for him.
      The world is to the rich and the fulness thereof. There&rsquo;s an
      insolvency court especially provided for de la Molle and his like&mdash;empty
      old windbags with long sounding names; let him go there and make room for
      the men who have made money&mdash;hee! hee! hee!&rdquo; And once more his
      voice went off into a sort of scream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Quest, who had enjoyed about enough of this kind of thing,
      changed the conversation by beginning to comment on various business
      transactions which he had been conducting on behalf of the house. The old
      man listened with the greatest interest, his keen black eyes attentively
      fixed upon the speaker&rsquo;s face, till at last Mr. Quest happened to
      mention that amongst others a certain Colonel Quaritch had opened an
      account with their branch of the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quaritch?&rdquo; said the old man eagerly, &ldquo;I know that name.
      Was he ever in the 105th Foot?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Quest, who knew everything about everybody,
      &ldquo;he was an ensign in that regiment during the Indian Mutiny, where
      he was badly wounded when still quite young, and got the Victoria Cross. I
      found it all out the other day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the man; that&rsquo;s the man,&rdquo; said old Mr.
      Cossey, jerking his head in an excited manner. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a
      blackguard; I tell you he&rsquo;s a blackguard; he jilted my wife&rsquo;s
      sister. She was twenty years younger than my wife&mdash;jilted her a week
      before her marriage, and would never give a reason, and she went mad and
      is in a madhouse how. I should like to have the ruining of him for it. I
      should like to drive him into the poor-house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Quest and Edward looked at each other, and the old man let his head
      fall back exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now good-bye, Mr. Quest, they&rsquo;ll give you a bit of dinner
      downstairs,&rdquo; he said at length. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting tired, and
      I want to hear the rest of that money article. You&rsquo;ve done very well
      for Cossey&rsquo;s and Cossey&rsquo;s will do well for you, for we always
      pay by results; that&rsquo;s the way to get good work and make a lot of
      money. Mind, Edward, if ever you get a chance don&rsquo;t forget to pay
      that blackguard Quaritch out pound for pound, and twice as much again for
      compound interest&mdash;hee! hee! hee!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old gentleman keeps his head for business pretty well,&rdquo;
      said Mr. Quest to Edward Cossey as soon as they were well outside the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keeps his head?&rdquo; answered Edward, &ldquo;I should just think
      he did. He&rsquo;s a regular shark now, that&rsquo;s what he is. I really
      believe that if he knew I had found thirty thousand for old de la Molle he
      would cut me off with a shilling.&rdquo; Here Mr. Quest pricked up his
      ears. &ldquo;And he&rsquo;s close, too,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;so close
      that it is almost impossible to get anything out of him. I am not
      particular, but upon my word I think that it is rather disgusting to see
      an old man with one foot in the grave hanging on to his moneybags as
      though he expected to float to heaven on them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Quest, &ldquo;it is a curious thing to think
      of, but, you see, money <i>is</i> his heaven.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said Edward, as they entered the study, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
      queer about that fellow Quaritch, isn&rsquo;t it? I never liked the look
      of him, with his pious air.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very queer, Mr. Cossey,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but do you know, I
      almost think that there must be some mistake? I do not believe that
      Colonel Quaritch is the man to do things of that sort without a very good
      reason. However, nobody can tell, and it is a long while ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A long while ago or not I mean to let him know my opinion of him
      when I get back to Boisingham,&rdquo; said Edward viciously. &ldquo;By
      Jove! it&rsquo;s twenty minutes past six, and in this establishment we
      dine at the pleasant hour of half-past. Won&rsquo;t you come and wash your
      hands.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Quest had a very good dinner, and contrary to his custom drank the
      best part of a bottle of old port after it. He had an unpleasant business
      to face that evening, and felt as though his nerves required bracing.
      About ten o&rsquo;clock he took his leave, and getting into a hansom bade
      the cabman drive to Rupert Street, Pimlico, where he arrived in due
      course. Having dismissed his cab, he walked slowly down the street till he
      reached a small house with red pillars to the doorway. Here he rang the
      bell. The door was opened by a middle-aged woman with a cunning face and a
      simper. Mr. Quest knew her well. Nominally the Tiger&rsquo;s servant, she
      was really her jackal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mrs. d&rsquo;Aubigne at home, Ellen?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; she answered with a simper, &ldquo;but she will be
      back from the music hall before long. She does not appear in the second
      part. But please come in, sir, you are quite a stranger here, and I am
      sure that Mrs. d&rsquo;Aubigne will be very glad to see you, for she have
      been dreadfully pressed for money of late, poor dear; nobody knows the
      trouble that I have had with those sharks of tradesmen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time they were upstairs in the drawing-room, and Ellen had turned
      the gas up. The room was well furnished in a certain gaudy style, which
      included a good deal of gilt and plate glass. Evidently, however, it had
      not been tidied since the Tiger had left it, for there on the table were
      cards thrown this way and that amidst an array of empty soda-water
      bottles, glasses with dregs of brandy in them, and other <i>debris</i>,
      such as the ends of cigars and cigarettes, and a little copper and silver
      money. On the sofa, too, lay a gorgeous tea gown resplendent with pink
      satin, also a pair of gold embroidered slippers, not over small, and an
      odd gant de Suede, with such an extraordinary number of buttons that it
      almost looked like the cast-off skin of a brown snake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see that your mistress has been having company, Ellen,&rdquo; he
      said coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, just a few lady friends to cheer her up a bit,&rdquo;
      answered the woman, with her abominable simper; &ldquo;poor dear, she do
      get that low with you away so much, and no wonder; and then all these
      money troubles, and she night by night working hard for her living at the
      music hall. Often and often have I seen her crying over it all&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he, breaking in upon her eloquence, &ldquo;I
      suppose that the lady friends smoke cigars. Well, clear away this mess and
      leave me&mdash;stop, give me a brandy-and-soda first. I will wait for your
      mistress.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman stopped talking and did as she was bid, for there was a look in
      Mr. Quest&rsquo;s eye which she did not quite like. So having placed the
      brandy-and-soda-water before him she left him to his own reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently they were not very pleasant ones. He walked round the room,
      which was reeking of patchouli or some such compound, well mixed with the
      odour of stale cigar smoke, looking absently at the gee-gar ornaments. On
      the mantelpiece were some photographs, and among them, to his disgust, he
      saw one of himself taken many years ago. With something as near an oath as
      he ever indulged in, he seized it, and setting fire to it over the gas,
      waited till the flames began to scorch his fingers, and then flung it,
      still burning, into the grate. Then he looked at himself in the glass in
      the mantelpiece&mdash;the room was full of mirrors&mdash;and laughed
      bitterly at the incongruity of his gentlemanlike, respectable, and even
      refined appearance, in that vulgar, gaudy, vicious-looking room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he bethought him of the letter in his wife&rsquo;s handwriting
      which he had stolen from the pocket of Edward Cossey&rsquo;s coat. He drew
      it out, and throwing the tea gown and the interminable glove off the sofa,
      sat down and began to read it. It was, as he had expected, a love letter,
      a wildly passionate love letter, breathing language which in some places
      almost touched the beauty of poetry, vows of undying affection that were
      throughout redeemed from vulgarity and even from silliness by their utter
      earnestness and self-abandonment. Had the letter been one written under
      happier circumstances and innocent of offence against morality, it would
      have been a beautiful letter, for passion at its highest has always a wild
      beauty of its own.
    </p>
    <p>
      He read it through and then carefully folded it and restored it to his
      pocket. &ldquo;The woman has a heart,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;no
      one can doubt it. And yet I could never touch it, though God knows however
      much I wronged her I loved her, yes, and love her now. Well, it is a good
      bit of evidence, if ever I dare to use it. It is a game of bluff between
      me and her, and I expect that in the end the boldest player will win.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose from the sofa&mdash;the atmosphere of the place stifled him, and
      going to the window threw it open and stepped out on to the balcony. It
      was a lovely moonlight night, though chilly, and for London the street was
      a quiet one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking a chair he sat down there upon the balcony and began to think. His
      heart was softened by misery and his mind fell into a tender groove. He
      thought of his long-dead mother, whom he had dearly loved, and of how he
      used to say his prayers to her, and of how she sang hymns to him on Sunday
      evenings. Her death had seemed to choke all the beauty out of his being at
      the time, and yet now he thanked heaven that she was dead. And then he
      thought of the accursed woman who had been his ruin, and of how she had
      entered into his life and corrupted and destroyed him. Next there rose up
      before him a vision of Belle, Belle as he had first seen her, a maid of
      seventeen, the only child of that drunken old village doctor, now also
      long since dead, and of how the sight of her had for a while stayed the
      corruption of his heart because he grew to love her. And then he married
      Belle by foul means, and the woman rose up in his path again, and he
      learnt that his wife hated him with all the energy of her passionate
      heart. Then came degradation after degradation, and the abandonment of
      principle after principle, replaced only by a fierce craving for
      respectability and rest, a long, long struggle, which ever ended in new
      lapses from the right, till at length he saw himself a hardened schemer,
      remorselessly pursued by a fury from whom there was no escape. And yet he
      knew that under other circumstances he might have been a good and happy
      man&mdash;leading an honourable life. But now all hope had gone, that
      which he was he must be till the end. He leaned his head upon the stone
      railing in front of him and wept, wept in the anguish of his soul, praying
      to heaven for deliverance from the burden of his sins, well knowing that
      he had none to hope for.
    </p>
    <p>
      For his chance was gone and his fate fixed.

      CHAPTER XVII. &mdash; THE TIGRESS IN HER DEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Presently a hansom cab came rattling down the street and pulled up at the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for it,&rdquo; said Mr. Quest to himself as he metaphorically
      shook himself together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next minute he heard a voice, which he knew only too well, a loud high
      voice say from the cab, &ldquo;Well, open the door, stupid, can&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, my lady fair,&rdquo; replied another voice&mdash;a
      coarse, somewhat husky male voice&mdash;&ldquo;adored Edithia, in one
      moment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come stow that and let me out,&rdquo; replied the adored Edithia
      sharply; and in another moment a large man in evening clothes, a horrible
      vulgar, carnal-looking man with red cheeks and a hanging under-lip,
      emerged into the lamp-light and turned to hand the lady out. As he did so
      the woman Ellen advanced from the doorway, and going to the cab door
      whispered something to its occupant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, Johnnie,&rdquo; said the lady, as she descended from the
      cab, so loudly that Mr. Quest on the balcony could hear every word,
      &ldquo;you must be off; Mr. d&rsquo;Aubigne has turned up, and perhaps he
      won&rsquo;t think three good company, so you had just best take this cab
      back again, my son, and that will save me the trouble of paying it. Come,
      cut.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;Aubigne,&rdquo; growled the flashy man with an oath,
      &ldquo;what do I care about d&rsquo;Aubigne? Advance, d&rsquo;Aubigne, and
      all&rsquo;s well! You needn&rsquo;t be jealous of me, I&rsquo;m&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now stop that noise and be off. He&rsquo;s a lawyer and he might
      not freeze on to you; don&rsquo;t you understand?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m a lawyer too and a pretty sharp one&mdash;<i>arcades
      ambo</i>,&rdquo; said Johnnie with a coarse laugh; &ldquo;and I tell you
      what it is, Edith, it ain&rsquo;t good enough to cart a fellow down in
      this howling wilderness and then send him away without a drink; lend us
      another fiver at any rate. It ain&rsquo;t good enough, I say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good enough or not you&rsquo;ll have to go and you don&rsquo;t get
      any fivers out of me to-night. Now pack sharp, or I&rsquo;ll know the
      reason why,&rdquo; and she pointed towards the cab in a fashion that
      seemed to cow her companion, for without another word he got into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another moment the cab had turned, and he was gone, muttering curses as
      he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman, who was none other than Mrs. d&rsquo;Aubigne, <i>alias</i>
      Edith Jones, <i>alias</i> the Tiger, turned and entered the house
      accompanied by her servant, Ellen, and presently Mr. Quest heard the
      rustle of her satin dress upon the stairs. He stepped back into the
      darkness of the balcony and waited. She opened the door, entered, and
      closed it behind her, and then, a little dazzled by the light, stood for
      some seconds looking about for her visitor. She was a thin, tall woman,
      who might have been any age between forty and fifty, with the wrecks of a
      very fine agile-looking figure. Her face, which was plentifully bedaubed
      with paint and powder, was sharp, fierce, and handsome, and crowned with a
      mane of false yellow hair. Her eyes were cold and blue, her lips thin and
      rather drawn, so as to show a double line of large and gleaming teeth. She
      was dressed in a rich and hideous tight-fitting gown of yellow satin,
      barred with black, and on her arms were long bright yellow gloves. She
      moved lightly and silently, and looked around her with a long-searching
      gaze, like that of a cat, and her general appearance conveyed an idea of
      hunger and wicked ferocity. Such was the outward appearance of the Tiger,
      and of a truth it justified her name. &ldquo;Why, where the dickens has he
      got to?&rdquo; she said aloud; &ldquo;I wonder if he has given me the
      slip?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I am, Edith,&rdquo; said Mr. Quest quietly, as he stepped from
      the balcony into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there you are, are you?&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;hiding away in
      the dark&mdash;just like your nasty mean ways. Well, my long-lost one, so
      you have come home at last, and brought the tin with you. Well, give us a
      kiss,&rdquo; and she advanced on him with her long arms outspread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Quest shivered visibly, and stretching out his hand, stopped her from
      coming near him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like paint.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The taunt stopped her, and for a moment an evil light shone in her cold
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder I have to paint,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when I am so
      worn out with poverty and hard work&mdash;not like the lovely Mrs. Q., who
      has nothing to do all day except spend the money that I ought to have. I&rsquo;ll
      tell you what it is, my fine fellow: you had better be careful, or I&rsquo;ll
      have that pretty cuckoo out of her soft nest, and pluck her borrowed
      feathers off her, like the monkey did to the parrot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you had better stop that talk, and come to business. I am
      in no mood for this sort of thing, Edith,&rdquo; and he turned round, shut
      the window, and drew the blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, all right; I&rsquo;m agreeable, I&rsquo;m sure. Stop a bit,
      though&mdash;I must have a brandy-and-soda first. I am as dry as a
      lime-kiln, and so would you be if you had to sing comic songs at a music
      hall for a living. There, that&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; and she put down the
      empty glass and threw herself on to the sofa. &ldquo;Now then, tune up as
      much as you like. How much tin have you brought?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Quest sat down by the table, and then, as though suddenly struck by a
      thought, rose again, and going to the door, opened it and looked out into
      the passage. There was nobody there, so he shut the door again, locked it,
      and then under cover of drawing the curtain which hung over it, slipped
      the key into his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you at there?&rdquo; said the woman suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just looking to see that Ellen was not at the key-hole, that&rsquo;s
      all. It would not be the first time that I have caught her there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just like your nasty low ways again,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
      got some game on. I&rsquo;ll be bound that you have got some game on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Quest seated himself again, and without taking any notice of this last
      remark began the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have brought you two hundred and fifty pounds,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two hundred and fifty pounds!&rdquo; she said, jumping up with a
      savage laugh. &ldquo;No, my boy, you don&rsquo;t get off for that if I
      know it. Why, I owe all that at this moment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better sit down and be quiet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or you
      will not get two hundred and fifty pence. In your own interest I recommend
      you to sit down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something about the man&rsquo;s voice and manner that scared the
      female savage before him, fierce as she was, and she sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;you are continually complaining
      of poverty; I come to your house&mdash;your house, mind you, not your
      rooms, and I find the <i>debris</i> of a card party lying about. I see
      champagne bottles freshly opened there in the corner. I see a dressing
      gown on the sofa that must have cost twenty or thirty pounds. I hear some
      brute associate of yours out in the street asking you to lend him another
      &lsquo;fiver.&rsquo; You complain of poverty and you have had over four
      hundred pounds from me this year alone, and I know that you earn twelve
      pounds a week at the music hall, and not five as you say. No, do not
      trouble to lie to me, for I have made enquiries.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spying again,&rdquo; said the woman with a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, spying, if you like; but there it is. And now to the point&mdash;I
      am not going on supplying you with money at this rate. I cannot do it and
      I will not do it. I am going to give you two hundred and fifty pounds now,
      and as much every year, and not one farthing more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more she sat up. &ldquo;You must be mad,&rdquo; she said in a tone
      that sounded more like a snarl than a human voice. &ldquo;Are you such a
      fool as to believe that I will be put off with two hundred and fifty
      pounds a year, I, <i>your legal wife?</i> I&rsquo;ll have you in the dock
      first, in the dock for bigamy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I do believe it for a reason that I
      shall give you presently. But first I want to go though our joint history,
      very briefly, just to justify myself if you like. Five-and-twenty years
      ago, or was it six-and-twenty, I was a boy of eighteen and you were a
      woman of twenty, a housemaid in my mother&rsquo;s house, and you made love
      to me. Then my mother was called away to nurse my brother who died at
      school at Portsmouth, and I fell sick with scarlet fever and you nursed me
      through it&mdash;it would have been kinder if you had poisoned me, and in
      my weak state you got a great hold over my mind, and I became attached to
      you, for you were handsome in those days. Then you dared me to marry you,
      and partly out of bravado, partly from affection, I took out a licence, to
      do which I made a false declaration that I was over age, and gave false
      names of the parishes in which we resided. Next day, half tipsy and not
      knowing what I did, I went through the form of marriage with you, and a
      few days afterwards my mother returned, observed that we were intimate,
      and dismissed you. You went without a word as to our marriage, which we
      both looked on a farce, and for years I lost sight of you. Fifteen years
      afterwards, when I had almost forgotten this adventure of my youth, I
      became acquainted with a young lady with whom I fell in love, and whose
      fortune, though not large, was enough to help me considerably in my
      profession as a country lawyer, in which I was doing well. I thought that
      you were dead, or that if you lived, the fact of my having made the false
      declaration of age and locality would be enough to invalidate the
      marriage, as would certainly have been the case if I had also made a false
      declaration of names; and my impulses and interests prompting me to take
      the risk, I married that lady. Then it was that you hunted me down, and
      then for the first time I did what I ought to have done before, and took
      the best legal opinions as to the validity of the former marriage, which,
      to my horror, I found was undoubtedly a binding one. You also took
      opinions and came to the same conclusion. Since then the history has been
      a simple one. Out of my wife&rsquo;s fortune of ten thousand pounds, I
      paid you no less than seven thousand as hush money, on your undertaking to
      leave this country for America, and never return here again. I should have
      done better to face it out, but I feared to lose my position and practice.
      You left and wrote to me that you too had married in Chicago, but in
      eighteen months you returned, having squandered every farthing of the
      money, when I found that the story of your marriage was an impudent lie.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she put in with a laugh, &ldquo;and a rare time I had
      with that seven thousand too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You returned and demanded more blackmail, and I had no choice but
      to give, and give, and give. In eleven years you had something over
      twenty-three thousand pounds from me, and you continually demand more. I
      believe you will admit that this is a truthful statement of the case,&rdquo;
      and he paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am not going to dispute that,
      but what then? I am your wife, and you have committed bigamy; and if you
      don&rsquo;t go on paying me I&rsquo;ll have you in gaol, and that&rsquo;s
      all about it, old boy. You can&rsquo;t get out of it any way, you nasty
      mean brute,&rdquo; she went on, raising her voice and drawing up her thin
      lips so as to show the white teeth beneath. &ldquo;So you thought that you
      were going to play it down low on me in that fashion, did you? Well, you&rsquo;ve
      just made a little mistake for once in your life, and I&rsquo;ll tell you
      what it is, you shall smart for it. I&rsquo;ll teach you what it is to
      leave your lawful wife to starve while you go and live with another woman
      in luxury. You can&rsquo;t help yourself; I can ruin you if I like.
      Supposing I go to a magistrate and ask for a warrant? What can you do to
      keep me quiet?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the virago stopped as though she were shot, and her fierce
      countenance froze into an appearance of terror, as well it might. Mr.
      Quest, who had been sitting listening to her with his hand over his eyes,
      had risen, and his face was as the face of a fiend, alight with an intense
      and quiet fury which seemed to be burning inwardly. On the mantelpiece lay
      a sharp-pointed Goorka knife, which one of Mrs. d&rsquo;Aubigne&rsquo;s
      travelled admirers had presented to her. It was an awful looking weapon,
      and keen-edged as a razor. This he had taken up and held in his right
      hand, and with it he was advancing towards her as she lounged on the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you make a sound I will kill you at once,&rdquo; he said,
      speaking in a low and husky voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been paralysed with terror, for like most bullies, male and
      female, she was a great coward, but the sound of his voice roused her. The
      first note of a harsh screech had already issued from her lips, when he
      sprang upon her, and placing the sharp point of the knife against her
      throat, pricked her with it. &ldquo;Be quiet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or
      you are a dead woman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped screaming and lay there, her face twitching, and her eyes
      bright with terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now listen,&rdquo; he said, in the same husky voice. &ldquo;You
      incarnate fiend, you asked me just now how I could keep you quiet. I will
      tell you; I can keep you quiet by running this knife up to the hilt in
      your throat,&rdquo; and once more he pricked her with its point. &ldquo;It
      would be murder,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;but I do not care for that. You
      and others between you have not made my life so pleasant for me that I am
      especially anxious to preserve it. Now, listen. I will give you the two
      hundred and fifty pounds that I have brought, and you shall have the two
      hundred and fifty a year. But if you ever again attempt to extort more, or
      if you molest me either by spreading stories against my character or by
      means of legal prosecution, or in any other way, I swear by the Almighty
      that I will murder you. I may have to kill myself afterwards&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
      care if I do, provided I kill you first. Do you understand me? you tiger,
      as you call yourself. If I have to hunt you down, as they do tigers, I
      will come up with you at last and <i>kill</i> you. You have driven me to
      it, and, by heaven! I will! Come, speak up, and tell me that you
      understand, or I may change my mind and do it now,&rdquo; and once more he
      touched her with the knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rolled off the sofa on to the floor and lay there, writhing in abject
      terror, looking in the shadow of the table, where her long lithe form was
      twisting about in its robe of yellow barred with black, more like one of
      the great cats from which she took her name than a human being. &ldquo;Spare
      me,&rdquo; she gasped, &ldquo;spare me, I don&rsquo;t want to die. I swear
      that I will never meddle with you again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want your oaths, woman,&rdquo; answered the stern
      form bending over her with the knife. &ldquo;A liar you have been from
      your youth up, and a liar you will be to the end. Do you understand what I
      have said?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I understand. Ah! put away that knife, I can&rsquo;t bear
      it! It makes me sick.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well then, get up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried to rise, but her knees would not support her, so she sat upon
      the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Mr. Quest, replacing the knife upon the
      mantelpiece, &ldquo;here is your money,&rdquo; and he flung a bag of notes
      and gold into her lap, at which she clutched eagerly and almost
      automatically. &ldquo;The two hundred and fifty pounds will be paid on the
      1st of January in each year, and not one farthing more will you get from
      me. Remember what I tell you, try to molest me by word or act, and you are
      a dead woman; I forbid you even to write to me. Now go to the devil in
      your own way,&rdquo; and without another word he took up his hat and
      umbrella, walked to the door, unlocked it and went, leaving the Tiger
      huddled together upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      For half-an-hour or more the woman remained thus, the bag of money in her
      hand. Then she struggled to her feet, her face livid and her body shaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as weak as a cat. I thought
      he meant to do it that time, and he will too, for sixpence. He&rsquo;s got
      me there. I am afraid to die. I can&rsquo;t bear to die. It is better to
      lose the money than to die. Besides, if I blow on him he&rsquo;ll be put
      in chokey and I shan&rsquo;t be able to get anything out of him, and when
      he comes out he&rsquo;ll do for me.&rdquo; And then, losing her temper,
      she shook her fist in the air and broke out into a flood of language such
      as would neither be pretty to hear nor good to repeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Quest was a man of judgment. At last he had realised that in one way,
      and one only, can a wild beast be tamed, and that is by terror.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII. &mdash; &ldquo;WHAT SOME HAVE FOUND SO SWEET&rdquo;
    </h2>
    <p>
      Time went on. Mr. Quest had been back at Boisingham for ten days or more,
      and was more cheerful than Belle (we can no longer call her his wife) had
      seen him for many a day. Indeed he felt as though ten years had been
      lifted off his back. He had taken a great and terrible decision and had
      acted upon it, and it had been successful, for he knew that his evil
      genius was so thoroughly terrified that for a long while at least he would
      be free from her persecution. But with Belle his relations remained as
      strained as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that the reader is in the secret of Mr. Quest&rsquo;s life, it will
      perhaps help him to understand the apparent strangeness of his conduct
      with reference to his wife and Edward Cossey. It is quite true that Belle
      did not know the full extent of her husband&rsquo;s guilt. She did not
      know that he was not her husband, but she did know that nearly all of her
      little fortune had been paid over to another woman, and that woman a
      common, vulgar woman, as one of Edith&rsquo;s letters which had fallen
      into her hands by chance very clearly showed her. Therefore, had he
      attempted to expose her proceedings or even to control her actions, she
      had in her hand an effective weapon of defence wherewith she could and
      would have given blow for blow. This state of affairs of necessity forced
      each party to preserve an armed neutrality towards the other, whilst they
      waited for a suitable opportunity to assert themselves. Not that their
      objects were quite the same. Belle merely wished to be free from her
      husband, whom she had always disliked, and whom she now positively hated
      with that curious hatred which women occasionally conceive toward those to
      whom they are legally bound, when they have been bad enough or unfortunate
      enough to fall in love with somebody else. He, on the contrary, had that
      desire for revenge upon her which even the gentler stamp of man is apt to
      conceive towards one who, herself the object of his strong affection,
      daily and hourly repels and repays it with scorn and infidelity. He did
      love her truly; she was the one living thing in all his bitter lonely life
      to whom his heart had gone out. True, he put pressure on her to marry him,
      or what comes to the same thing, allowed and encouraged her drunken old
      father to do so. But he had loved her and still loved her, and yet she
      mocked at him, and in the face of that fact about the money&mdash;her
      money, which he had paid away to the other woman, a fact which it was
      impossible for him to explain except by admission of guilt which would be
      his ruin, what was he to urge to convince her of this, even had she been
      open to conviction? But it was bitter to him, bitter beyond all
      conception, to have this, the one joy of his life, snatched from him. He
      threw himself with ardour into the pursuit after wealth and dignity of
      position, partly because he had a legitimate desire for these things, and
      partly to assuage the constant irritation of his mind, but to no purpose.
      These two spectres of his existence, his tiger wife and the fair woman who
      was his wife in name, constantly marched side by side before him, blotting
      out the beauty from every scene and souring the sweetness of every joy.
      But if in his pain he thirsted for revenge upon Belle, who would have none
      of him, how much more did he desire to be avenged upon Edward Cossey, who,
      as it were, had in sheer wantonness robbed him of the one good thing he
      had? It made him mad to think that this man, to whom he knew himself to be
      in every way superior, should have had the power thus to injure him, and
      he longed to pay him back measure for measure, and through <i>his</i>
      heart&rsquo;s affections to strike him as mortal a blow as he had himself
      received.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Quest was no doubt a bad man; his whole life was a fraud, he was
      selfish and unscrupulous in his schemes and relentless in their execution,
      but whatever may have been the measure of his iniquities, he was not
      doomed to wait for another world to have them meted out to him again. His
      life, indeed, was full of miseries, the more keenly felt because of the
      high pitch and capacity of his nature, and perhaps the sharpest of them
      all was the sickening knowledge that had it not been for that one fatal
      error of his boyhood, that one false step down the steep of Avernus, he
      might have been a good and even a great man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just now, however, his load was a little lightened, and he was able to
      devote himself to his money-making and to the weaving of the web that was
      to destroy his rival, Edward Cossey, with a mind a little less preoccupied
      with other cares.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, things at the Castle were going very pleasantly for everybody.
      The Squire was as happy in attending to the various details connected with
      the transfer of the mortgages as though he had been lending thirty
      thousand pounds instead of borrowing them. The great George was happy in
      the accustomed flow of cash, that enabled him to treat Janter with a lofty
      scorn not unmingled with pity, which was as balm to his harassed soul, and
      also to transact an enormous amount of business in his own peculiar way
      with men up trees and otherwise. For had he not to stock the Moat Farm,
      and was not Michaelmas at hand?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida, too, was happy, happier than she had been since her brother&rsquo;s
      death, for reasons that have already been hinted at. Besides, Mr. Edward
      Cossey was out of the way, and that to Ida was a very great thing, for his
      presence to her was what a policeman is to a ticket-of-leave man&mdash;a
      most unpleasant and suggestive sight. She fully realised the meaning and
      extent of the bargain into which she had entered to save her father and
      her house, and there lay upon her the deep shadow of evil that was to
      come. Every time she saw her father bustling about with his business
      matters and his parchments, every time the universal George arrived with
      an air of melancholy satisfaction and a long list of the farming stock and
      implements he had bought at some neighbouring Michaelmas sale, the shadow
      deepened, and she heard the clanking of her chains. Therefore she was the
      more thankful for her respite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold Quaritch was happy too, though in a somewhat restless and peculiar
      way. Mrs. Jobson (the old lady who attended to his wants at Molehill, with
      the help of a gardener and a simple village maid, her niece, who smashed
      all the crockery and nearly drove the Colonel mad by banging the doors,
      shifting his papers and even dusting his trays of Roman coins) actually
      confided to some friends in the village that she thought the poor dear
      gentleman was going mad. When questioned on what she based this belief,
      she replied that he would walk up and down the oak-panelled dining-room by
      the hour together, and then, when he got tired of that exercise, whereby,
      said Mrs. Jobson, he had already worn a groove in the new Turkey carpet,
      he would take out a &ldquo;rokey&rdquo; (foggy) looking bit of a picture,
      set it upon a chair and stare at it through his fingers, shaking his head
      and muttering all the while. Then&mdash;further and conclusive proof of a
      yielding intellect&mdash;he would get a half-sheet of paper with some
      writing on it and put it on the mantelpiece and stare at that. Next he
      would turn it upside down and stare at it so, then sideways, then all
      ways, then he would hold it before a looking-glass and stare at the
      looking-glass, and so on. When asked how she knew all this, she confessed
      that her niece Jane had seen it through the key-hole, not once but often.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, as the practised and discerning reader will clearly understand,
      this meant only that when walking and wearing out the carpet the Colonel
      was thinking of Ida. When contemplating the painting that she had given
      him, he was admiring her work and trying to reconcile the admiration with
      his conscience and his somewhat peculiar views of art. And when glaring at
      the paper, he was vainly endeavouring to make head or tale of the message
      written to his son on the night before his execution by Sir James de la
      Molle in the reign of Charles I., confidently believed by Ida to contain a
      key to the whereabouts of the treasure he was supposed to have secreted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course the tale of this worthy soul, Mrs. Jobson, did not lose in the
      telling, and when it reached Ida&rsquo;s ears, which it did at last
      through the medium of George&mdash;for in addition to his numberless other
      functions, George was the sole authorised purveyor of village and county
      news&mdash;it read that Colonel Quaritch had gone raving mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes afterwards this raving lunatic arrived at the Castle in dress
      clothes and his right mind, whereon Ida promptly repeated her thrilling
      history, somewhat to the subsequent discomfort of Mrs. Jobson and Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one, as somebody once said with equal truth and profundity, knows what
      a minute may bring forth, much less, therefore, does anybody know what an
      evening of say two hundred and forty minutes may produce. For instance,
      Harold Quaritch&mdash;though by this time he had gone so far as to freely
      admit to himself that he was utterly and hopelessly in love with Ida, in
      love with her with that settled and determined passion which sometimes
      strikes a man or woman in middle age&mdash;certainly did not know that
      before the evening was out he would have declared his devotion with
      results that shall be made clear in their decent order. When he put on his
      dress clothes to come up to dinner, he had no more intention of proposing
      to Ida than he had of not taking them off when he went to bed. His love
      was deep enough and steady enough, but perhaps it did not possess that
      wild impetuosity which carries people so far in their youth, sometimes
      indeed a great deal further than their reason approves. It was essentially
      a middle-aged devotion, and bore the same resemblance to the picturesque
      passion of five-and-twenty that a snow-fed torrent does to a navigable
      river. The one rushes and roars and sweeps away the bridges and devastates
      happy homes, while the other bears upon its placid breast the argosies of
      peace and plenty and is generally serviceable to the necessities of man.
      Still, there is something attractive about torrents. There is a grandeur
      in that first rush of passion which results from the sudden melting of the
      snows of the heart&rsquo;s purity and faith and high unstained devotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But both torrents and navigable rivers are liable to a common fate, they
      may fall over precipices, and when this comes to pass even the latter
      cease to be navigable for a space. Now this catastrophe was about to
      overtake our friend the Colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, Harold Quaritch had dined, and had enjoyed a pleasant as well as a
      good dinner. The Squire, who of late had been cheerful as a cricket, was
      in his best form, and told long stories with an infinitesimal point. In
      anybody else&rsquo;s mouth these stories would have been wearisome to a
      degree, but there was a gusto, an originality, and a kind of Tudor period
      flavour about the old gentleman, which made his worst and longest story
      acceptable in any society. The Colonel himself had also come out in a most
      unusual way. He possessed a fund of dry humour which he rarely produced,
      but when he did produce it, it was of a most satisfactory order. On this
      particular night it was all on view, greatly to the satisfaction of Ida,
      who was a witty as well as a clever woman. And so it came to pass that the
      dinner was a very pleasant one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold and the Squire were still sitting over their wine. The latter was
      for the fifth time giving his guest a full and particular account of how
      his deceased aunt, Mrs. Massey, had been persuaded by a learned
      antiquarian to convert or rather to restore Dead Man&rsquo;s Mount into
      its supposed primitive condition of an ancient British dwelling, and of
      the extraordinary expression of her face when the bill came in, when
      suddenly the servant announced that George was waiting to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman grumbled a great deal, but finally got up and went to
      enjoy himself for the next hour or so in talking about things in general
      with his retainer, leaving his guest to find his way to the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Colonel reached the room, he found Ida seated at the piano,
      singing. She heard him shut the door, looked round, nodded prettily, and
      then went on with her singing. He came and sat down on a low chair some
      two paces from her, placing himself in such a position that he could see
      her face, which indeed he always found a wonderfully pleasant object of
      contemplation. Ida was playing without music&mdash;the only light in the
      room was that of a low lamp with a red fringe to it. Therefore, he could
      not see very much, being with difficulty able to trace the outlines of her
      features, but if the shadow thus robbed him, it on the other hand lent her
      a beauty of its own, clothing her face with an atmosphere of wonderful
      softness which it did not always possess in the glare of day. The Colonel
      indeed (we must remember that he was in love and that it was after dinner)
      became quite poetical (internally of course) about it, and in his heart
      compared her first to St. Cecilia at her organ, and then to the Angel of
      the Twilight. He had never seen her look so lovely. At her worst she was a
      handsome and noble-looking woman, but now the shadow from without, and
      though he knew nothing of that, the shadow from her heart within also,
      aided maybe by the music&rsquo;s swell, had softened and purified her face
      till it did indeed look almost like an angel&rsquo;s. It is strong,
      powerful faces that are capable of the most tenderness, not the soft and
      pretty ones, and even in a plain person, when such a face is in this way
      seen, it gathers a peculiar beauty of its own. But Ida was not a plain
      person, so on the whole it is scarcely wonderful that a certain effect was
      produced upon Harold Quaritch. Ida went on singing almost without a break&mdash;to
      outward appearance, at any rate, all unconscious of what was passing in
      her admirer&rsquo;s mind. She had a good memory and a sweet voice, and
      really liked music for its own sake, so it was no great effort to her to
      do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, she sang a song from Tennyson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Maud,&rdquo; the
      tender and beautiful words whereof will be familiar to most readers of her
      story. It began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O let the solid ground Not fail beneath my feet Before my life has
      found What some have found so sweet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The song is a lovely one, nor did it suffer from her rendering, and the
      effect it produced upon Harold was of a most peculiar nature. All his past
      life seemed to heave and break beneath the magic of the music and the
      magic of the singer, as a northern field of ice breaks up beneath the
      outburst of the summer sun. It broke, sank, and vanished into the depths
      of his nature, those dread unmeasured depths that roll and murmur in the
      vastness of each human heart as the sea rolls beneath its cloak of ice;
      that roll and murmur here, and set towards a shore of which we have no
      chart or knowledge. The past was gone, the frozen years had melted, and
      once more the sweet strong air of youth blew across his heart, and once
      more there was clear sky above, wherein the angels sailed. Before the
      breath of that sweet song the barrier of self fell down, his being went
      out to meet her being, and all the sleeping possibilities of life rose
      from the buried time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat and listened, trembling as he listened, till the gentle echoes of
      the music died upon the quiet air. They died, and were gathered into the
      emptiness which receives and records all things, leaving him broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to him, smiling faintly, for the song had moved her also, and
      he felt that he must speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a beautiful song,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;sing it again if
      you do not mind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She made no answer, but once more she sang:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O let the solid ground Not fail beneath my feet Before my life has
      found What some have found so sweet;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      and then suddenly broke off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you looking at me?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can feel you
      looking at me and it makes me nervous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent towards her and looked her in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you, Ida,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I love you with all my
      heart,&rdquo; and he stopped suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned quite pale, even in that light he could see her pallor, and her
      hands fell heavily on the keys.
    </p>
    <p>
      The echo of the crashing notes rolled round the room and slowly died away&mdash;but
      still she said nothing.

      CHAPTER XIX. &mdash; IN PAWN
    </h2>
    <h3>
      At last she spoke, apparently with a great effort.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is stifling in here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;let us go out.&rdquo;
      She rose, took up a shawl that lay beside her on a chair, and stepped
      through the French window into the garden. It was a lovely autumn night,
      and the air was still as death, with just a touch of frost in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida threw the shawl over her shoulders and followed by Harold walked on
      through the garden till she came to the edge of the moat, where there was
      a seat. Here she sat down and fixed her eyes upon the hoary battlements of
      the gateway, now clad in a solemn robe of moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold looked at her and felt that if he had anything to say the time had
      come for him to say it, and that she had brought him here in order that
      she might be able to listen undisturbed. So he began again, and told her
      that he loved her dearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am some seventeen years older than you,&rdquo; he went on,
      &ldquo;and I suppose that the most active part of my life lies in the
      past; and I don&rsquo;t know if, putting other things aside, you could
      care to marry so old a man, especially as I am not rich. Indeed, I feel it
      presumptuous on my part, seeing what you are and what I am not, to ask you
      to do so. And yet, Ida, I believe if you could care for me that, with
      heaven&rsquo;s blessing, we should be very happy together. I have led a
      lonely life, and have had little to do with women&mdash;once, many years
      ago, I was engaged, and the matter ended painfully, and that is all. But
      ever since I first saw your face in the drift five years and more ago, it
      has haunted me and been with me. Then I came to live here and I have
      learnt to love you, heaven only knows how much, and I should be ashamed to
      try to put it into words, for they would sound foolish. All my life is
      wrapped up in you, and I feel as though, should you see me no more, I
      could never be a happy man again,&rdquo; and he paused and looked
      anxiously at her face, which was set and drawn as though with pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot say &lsquo;yes,&rsquo; Colonel Quaritch,&rdquo; she
      answered at length, in a tone that puzzled him, it was so tender and so
      unfitted to the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;I suppose that you do not
      care for me? Of course, I have no right to expect that you would.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I have said that I cannot say &lsquo;yes,&rsquo; Colonel
      Quaritch, do you not think that I had better leave that question
      unanswered?&rdquo; she replied in the same soft notes which seemed to draw
      the heart out of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she broke in with a bitter little laugh, &ldquo;shall I
      tell you why? Because I am <i>in pawn!</i> Look,&rdquo; she went on,
      pointing to the stately towers and the broad lands beyond. &ldquo;You see
      this place. <i>I</i> am security for it, I <i>myself</i> in my own person.
      Had it not been for me it would have been sold over our heads after having
      descended in our family for all these centuries, put upon the market and
      sold for what it would fetch, and my old father would have been turned out
      to die, for it would have killed him. So you see I did what unfortunate
      women have often been driven to do, I sold myself body and soul; and I got
      a good price too&mdash;thirty thousand pounds!&rdquo; and suddenly she
      burst into a flood of tears, and began to sob as though her heart would
      break.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Harold Quaritch looked on bewildered, not in the least
      understanding what Ida meant, and then he followed the impulse common to
      mankind in similar circumstances and took her in his arms. She did not
      resent the movement, indeed she scarcely seemed to notice it, though to
      tell the truth, for a moment or two, which to the Colonel seemed the
      happiest of his life, her head rested on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost instantly, however, she raised it, freed herself from his embrace
      and ceased weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I have told you so much,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I suppose that
      I had better tell you everything. I know that whatever the temptation,&rdquo;
      and she laid great stress upon the words, &ldquo;under any conceivable
      circumstances &mdash;indeed, even if you believed that you were serving me
      in so doing&mdash;I can rely upon you never to reveal to anybody, and
      above all to my father, what I now tell you,&rdquo; and she paused and
      looked up at him with eyes in which the tears still swam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, you can rely on me,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. I am sure that I shall never have to reproach you with
      the words. I will tell you. I have virtually promised to marry Mr. Edward
      Cossey, should he at any time be in a position to claim fulfilment of the
      promise, on condition of his taking up the mortgages on Honham, which he
      has done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold Quaritch took a step back and looked at her in horrified
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>What?</i>&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; she answered hastily, putting up her hand as
      though to shield herself from a blow. &ldquo;I know what you mean; but do
      not think too hardly of me if you can help it. It was not for myself. I
      would rather work for my living with my hands than take a price, for there
      is no other word for it. It was for my father, and my family too. I could
      not bear to think of the old place going to the hammer, and I did it all
      in a minute without consideration; but,&rdquo; and she set her face,
      &ldquo;even as things are, I believe I should do it again, because I think
      that no one woman has a right to destroy her family in order to please
      herself. If one of the two must go, let it be the woman. But don&rsquo;t
      think hardly of me for it,&rdquo; she added almost pleadingly, &ldquo;that
      is if you can help it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not thinking of you,&rdquo; he answered grimly; &ldquo;by
      heaven I honour you for what you have done, for however much I may
      disagree with the act, it is a noble one. I am thinking of the man who
      could drive such a bargain with any woman. You say that you have promised
      to marry him should he ever be in a position to claim it. What do you mean
      by that? As you have told me so much you may as well tell me the rest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke clearly and with a voice full of authority, but his bearing did
      not seem to jar upon Ida.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant,&rdquo; she answered humbly, &ldquo;that I believe&mdash;of
      course I do not know if I am right&mdash;I believe that Mr. Cossey is in
      some way entangled with a lady, in short with Mrs. Quest, and that the
      question of whether or no he comes forward again depends upon her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; said the Colonel, &ldquo;upon my word the
      thing gets worse and worse. I never heard anything like it; and for money
      too! The thing is beyond me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;there it is. And now,
      Colonel Quaritch, one word before I go in. It is difficult for me to speak
      without saying too much or too little, but I do want you to understand how
      honoured and how grateful I feel for what you have told me to-night&mdash;I
      am so little worthy of all you have given me, and to be honest, I cannot
      feel as pained about it as I ought to feel. It is feminine vanity, you
      know, nothing else. I am sure that you will not press me to say more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;no. I think that I understand the
      position. But, Ida, there is one thing that I must ask&mdash;you will
      forgive me if I am wrong in doing so, but all this is very sad for me. If
      in the end circumstances should alter, as I pray heaven that they may, or
      if Mr. Cossey&rsquo;s previous entanglement should prove too much for him,
      will you marry me, Ida?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought for a moment, and then rising from the seat, gave him her hand
      and said simply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I <i>will</i> marry you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no answer, but lifting her hand touched it gently with his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meanwhile,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;I have your promise, and I am
      sure that you will not betray it, come what may.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will not betray it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And they went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the drawing-room they found the Squire puzzling over a sheet of paper,
      on which were scrawled some of George&rsquo;s accounts, in figures which
      at first sight bore about as much resemblance to Egyptian hieroglyphics as
      they did to those in use to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there you are. Where on earth have
      you been?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have been looking at the Castle in the moonlight,&rdquo;
      answered Ida coolly. &ldquo;It is beautiful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um&mdash;ah,&rdquo; said the Squire, dryly, &ldquo;I have no doubt
      that it is beautiful, but isn&rsquo;t the grass rather damp? Well, look
      here,&rdquo; and he held up the sheet of hieroglyphics, &ldquo;perhaps you
      can add this up, Ida, for it is more than I can. George has bought stock
      and all sorts of things at the sale to-day and here is his account; three
      hundred and seventy-two pounds he makes it, but I make it four hundred and
      twenty, and hang me if I can find out which is right. It is most important
      that these accounts should be kept straight. Most important, and I cannot
      get this stupid fellow to do it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida took the sheet of paper and added it up, with the result that she
      discovered both totals to be wrong. Harold, watching her, wondered at the
      nerve of a woman who, after going through such a scene as that which had
      just occurred, could deliberately add up long rows of badly-written
      figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this money which her father was expending so cheerfully was part of
      the price for which she had bound herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a sigh he rose, said good-night, and went home with feelings almost
      too mixed to admit of accurate description. He had taken a great step in
      his life, and to a certain extent that step had succeeded. He had not
      altogether built his hopes upon sand, for from what Ida had said, and
      still more from what she had tacitly admitted, it was necessarily clear to
      him that she did more or less regard him as a man would wish to be
      regarded by a woman whom he dearly loved. This was a great deal, more
      indeed than he had dared to believe, but then, as is usually the case in
      this imperfect world, where things but too often seem to be carefully
      arranged at sixes and sevens, came the other side of the shield. Of what
      use to him was it to have won this sweet woman&rsquo;s love, of what use
      to have put this pure water of happiness to his lips in the desert of his
      lonely life, only to see the cup that held it shattered at a blow? To him
      the story of the money loan&mdash;in consideration of which, as it were,
      Ida had put herself in pawn, as the Egyptians used to put the mummies of
      their fathers in pawn&mdash;was almost incredible. To a person of his
      simple and honourable nature, it seemed a preposterous and unheard of
      thing that any man calling himself a gentleman should find it possible to
      sink so low as to take such advantage of a woman&rsquo;s dire necessity
      and honourable desire to save her father from misery and her race from
      ruin, and to extract from her a promise of marriage in consideration of
      value received. Putting aside his overwhelming personal interest in the
      matter, it made his blood boil to think that such a thing could be. And
      yet it was, and what was more, he believed he knew Ida well enough to be
      convinced that she would not shirk the bargain. If Edward Cossey came
      forward to claim his bond it would be paid down to the last farthing. It
      was a question of thirty thousand pounds; the happiness of his life and of
      Ida&rsquo;s depended upon a sum of money. If the money were forthcoming,
      Cossey could not claim his flesh and blood. But where was it to come from?
      He himself was worth perhaps ten thousand pounds, or with the commutation
      value of his pension, possibly twelve, and he had not the means of raising
      a farthing more. He thought the position over till he was tired of
      thinking, and then with a heavy heart and yet with a strange glow of
      happiness shining through his grief, like sunlight through a grey sky, at
      last he went to sleep and dreamed that Ida had gone from him, and that he
      was once more utterly alone in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if he had cause for trouble, how much more was it so with Ida? Poor
      woman! under her somewhat cold and stately exterior lay a deep and at
      times a passionate nature. For some weeks she had been growing strangely
      attracted to Harold Quaritch, and now she knew that she loved him, so that
      there was no one thing that she desired more in this wide world than to
      become his wife. And yet she was bound, bound by a sense of honour and a
      sense too of money received, to stay at the beck and call of a man she
      detested, and if at any time it pleased him to throw down the
      handkerchief, to be there to pick it up and hold it to her breast. It was
      bad enough to have had this hanging over her head when she was herself
      more or less in a passive condition, and therefore to a certain extent
      reckless as to her future; but now that her heart was alight with the holy
      flame of a good woman&rsquo;s love, now that her whole nature rebelled and
      cried out aloud against the sacrilege involved, it was both revolting and
      terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet so far as she could see there was no great probability of escape.
      A shrewd and observant woman, she could gauge Mr. Cossey&rsquo;s condition
      of mind towards herself with more or less accuracy. Also she did not think
      it in the least likely that having spent thirty thousand pounds to advance
      his object, he would be content to let his advantage drop. Such a course
      would be repellent to his trading instincts. She knew in her heart that
      the hour was not far off when he would claim his own, and that unless some
      accident occurred to prevent it, it was practically certain that she would
      be called upon to fulfil her pledge, and whilst loving another man to
      become the wife of Edward Cossey.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX. &mdash; &ldquo;GOOD-BYE TO YOU, EDWARD&rdquo;
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was on the day following the one upon which Harold proposed to Ida,
      that Edward Cossey returned to Boisingham. His father had so far recovered
      from his attack as to be at last prevailed upon to allow his departure,
      being chiefly moved thereto by the supposition that Cossey and Son&rsquo;s
      branch establishments were suffering from his son&rsquo;s absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, in his high, piercing voice, &ldquo;business
      is business, and must be attended to, so perhaps you had better go. They
      talk about the fleeting character of things, but there is one thing that
      never changes, and that is money. Money is immortal; men may come and men
      may go, but money goes on for ever. Hee! hee! money is the honey-pot, and
      men are the flies; and some get their fill and some stick their wings, but
      the honey is always there, so never mind the flies. No, never mind me
      either; you go and look after the honey, Edward. Money&mdash;honey, honey&mdash;money,
      they rhyme, don&rsquo;t they? And look here, by the way, if you get a
      chance&mdash;and the world is full of chances to men who have plenty of
      money&mdash;mind you don&rsquo;t forget to pay out that half-pay Colonel&mdash;what&rsquo;s
      his name?&mdash;Quaritch. He played our family a dirty trick, and there&rsquo;s
      your poor Aunt Julia in a lunatic asylum to this moment and a constant
      source of expense to us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And so Edward bade his estimable parent farewell and departed. Nor in
      truth did he require any admonition from Mr. Cossey, Senior, to make him
      anxious to do Colonel Quaritch an ill-turn if the opportunity should
      serve. Mrs. Quest, in her numerous affectionate letters, had more than
      once, possibly for reasons of her own, given him a full and vivid <i>resume</i>
      of the local gossip about the Colonel and Ida, who were, she said,
      according to common report, engaged to be married. Now, absence had not by
      any means cooled Edward&rsquo;s devotion to Miss de la Molle, which was a
      sincere one enough in its own way. On the contrary, the longer he was away
      from her the more his passion grew, and with it a vigorous undergrowth of
      jealousy. He had, it is true, Ida&rsquo;s implied promise that she would
      marry him if he chose to ask her, but on this he put no great reliance.
      Hence his hurry to return to Boisingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving London by an afternoon train, he reached Boisingham about
      half-past six, and in pursuance of an arrangement already made, went to
      dine with the Quests. When he reached the house he found Belle alone in
      the drawing-room, for her husband, having come in late, was still
      dressing, but somewhat to his relief he had no opportunity of private
      conversation with her, for a servant was in the room, attending to the
      fire, which would not burn. The dinner passed off quietly enough, though
      there was an ominous look about the lady&rsquo;s face which, being
      familiar with these signs of the feminine weather, he did not altogether
      like. After dinner, however, Mr. Quest excused himself, saying that he had
      promised to attend a local concert in aid of the funds for the restoration
      of the damaged pinnacle of the parish church, and he was left alone with
      the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it was that all her pent-up passion broke out. She overwhelmed him
      with her affection, she told him that her life had been a blank while he
      was away, she reproached him with the scarcity and coldness of his
      letters, and generally went on in a way with which he was but too well
      accustomed, and, if the truth must be told, heartily tired. His mood was
      an irritable one, and to-night the whole thing wearied him beyond bearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Belle,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;for goodness&rsquo;
      sake be a little more rational. You are getting too old for this sort of
      tomfoolery, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She sprang up and faced him, her eyes flashing and her breast heaving with
      jealous anger. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Are you
      tired of me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not say that,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but as you have
      started the subject I must tell you that I think all this has gone far
      enough. Unless it is stopped I believe we shall both be ruined. I am sure
      that your husband is becoming suspicious, and as I have told you again and
      again, if once the business gets to my father&rsquo;s ears he will
      disinherit me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Belle stood quite still till he had finished. She had assumed her
      favourite attitude and crossed her arms behind her back, and her sweet
      childish face was calm and very white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the good of making excuses and telling me what is not true,
      Edward?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;One never hears a man who loves a woman
      talk like that; prudence comes with weariness, and men grow circumspect
      when there is nothing more to gain. You <i>are</i> tired of me. I have
      seen it a long time, but like a blind fool I have tried not to believe it.
      It is not a great reward to a woman who has given her whole life to a man,
      but perhaps it is as much as she can expect, for I do not want to be
      unjust to you. I am the most to blame, because we need never take a false
      step except of our own free will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; he said impatiently, &ldquo;what of it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only this, Edward. I have still a little pride left, and as you are
      tired of me, why&mdash;<i>go</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried hard to prevent it, but do what he would, a look of relief
      struggled into his face. She saw it, and it stung her almost to madness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not look so happy, Edward; it is scarcely decent; and,
      besides, you have not heard all that I have to say. I know what this
      arises from. You are in love with Ida de la Molle. Now <i>there</i> I draw
      the line. You may leave me if you like, but you shall not marry Ida while
      I am alive to prevent it. That is more than I can bear. Besides, like a
      wise woman, she wishes to marry Colonel Quaritch, who is worth two of you,
      Edward Cossey.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not believe it,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;and what right have
      you to say that I am in love with Miss de la Molle? And if I am in love
      with her, how can you prevent me from marrying her if I choose?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try and you will see,&rdquo; she answered, with a little laugh.
      &ldquo;And now, as the curtain has dropped, and it is all over between us,
      why the best thing that we can do is to put out the lights and go to bed,&rdquo;
      and she laughed again and courtesied with much assumed playfulness.
      &ldquo;Good-night, Mr. Cossey; good-night, and good-bye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hand. &ldquo;Come, Belle,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
      let us part like this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head and once more put her arms behind her. &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
      she answered, &ldquo;I will not take your hand. Of my own free will I
      shall never touch it again, for to me it is like the hand of the dead.
      Good-bye, once more; good-bye to you, Edward, and to all the happiness
      that I ever had. I built up my life upon my love for you, and you have
      shattered it like glass. I do not reproach you; you have followed after
      your nature and I must follow after mine, and in time all things will come
      right&mdash;in the grave. I shall not trouble you any more, provided that
      you do not try to marry Ida, for that I will not bear. And now go, for I
      am very tired,&rdquo; and turning, she rang the bell for the servant to
      show him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another minute he was gone. She listened till she heard the front door
      close behind him, and then gave way to her grief. Flinging herself upon
      the sofa, she covered her face with her hands and moaned bitterly, weeping
      for the past, and weeping, too, for the long desolate years that were to
      come. Poor woman! whatever was the measure of her sin it had assuredly
      found her out, as our sins always do find us out in the end. She had loved
      this man with a love which has no parallel in the hearts of well-ordered
      and well-brought-up women. She never really lived till this fatal passion
      took possession of her, and now that its object had deserted her, her
      heart felt as though it was dead within her. In that short half-hour she
      suffered more than many women do in their whole lives. But the paroxysm
      passed, and she rose pale and trembling, with set teeth and blazing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had better be careful,&rdquo; she said to herself; &ldquo;he may
      go, but if he tries to marry Ida I will keep my word&mdash;yes, for her
      sake as well as his.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Edward Cossey came to consider the position, which he did seriously,
      on the following morning, he did not find it very satisfactory. To begin
      with, he was not altogether a heartless man, and such a scene as that
      which he had passed through on the previous evening was in itself quite
      enough to upset his nerves. At one time, at any rate, he had been much
      attached to Mrs. Quest; he had never borne her any violent affection; that
      had all been on her side, but still he had been fond of her, and if he
      could have done so, would probably have married her. Even now he was
      attached to her, and would have been glad to remain her friend if she
      would have allowed it. But then came the time when her heroics began to
      weary him, and he on his side began to fall in love with Ida de la Molle,
      and as he drew back so she came forward, till at length he was worn out,
      and things culminated as has been described. He was sorry for her too,
      knowing how deeply she was attached to him, though it is probable that he
      did not in the least realise the extent to which she suffered, for neither
      men nor women who have intentionally or otherwise been the cause of
      intense mental anguish to one of the opposite sex ever do quite realise
      this. They, not unnaturally, measure the trouble by the depth of their
      own, and are therefore very apt to come to erroneous conclusions. Of
      course this is said of cases where all the real passion is on one side,
      and indifference or comparative indifference on the other; for where it is
      mutual, the grief will in natures of equal depth be mutual also.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate, Edward Cossey was quite sensitive enough to acutely feel
      parting with Mrs. Quest, and perhaps he felt the manner of it even more
      than the fact of the separation. Then came another consideration. He was,
      it is true, free from his entanglement, in itself an enormous relief, but
      the freedom was of a conditional nature. Belle had threatened trouble in
      the most decisive tones should he attempt to carry out his secret purpose
      of marrying Ida, which she had not been slow to divine. For some occult
      reason, at least to him it seemed occult, the idea of this alliance was
      peculiarly distasteful to her, though no doubt the true explanation was
      that she believed, and not inaccurately, that in order to bring it about
      he was bent upon deserting her. The question with him was, would she or
      would she not attempt to put her threat into execution? It certainly
      seemed to him difficult to imagine what steps she could take to that end,
      seeing that any such steps would necessarily involve her own exposure, and
      that too when there was nothing to gain, and when all hopes of thereby
      securing him for herself had passed away. Nor did he seriously believe
      that she would attempt anything of the sort. It is one thing for a woman
      to make such threats in the acute agony of her jealousy, and quite another
      for her to carry them out in cold blood. Looking at the matter from a man&rsquo;s
      point of view, it seemed to him extremely improbable that when the
      occasion came she would attempt such a move. He forgot how much more
      violently, when once it has taken possession of his being, the storm of
      passion sweeps through such a woman&rsquo;s heart than through a man&rsquo;s,
      and how utterly reckless to all consequence the former sometimes becomes.
      For there are women with whom all things melt in that white heat of
      anguished jealousy&mdash;honour, duty, conscience, and the restraint of
      religion&mdash;and of these Belle Quest was one.
    </p>
    <p>
      But of this he was not aware, and though he recognised a risk, he saw in
      it no sufficient reason to make him stay his hand. For day by day the
      strong desire to make Ida his wife had grown upon him, till at last it
      possessed him body and soul. For a long while the intent had been
      smouldering in his breast, and the tale that he now heard, to the effect
      that Colonel Quaritch had been beforehand with him, had blown it into a
      flame. Ida was ever present in his thoughts; even at night he could not be
      rid of her, for when he slept her vision, dark-eyed and beautiful, came
      stealing down his dreams. She was his heaven, and if by any ladder known
      to man he might climb thereto, thither he would climb. And so he set his
      teeth and vowed that, Mrs. Quest or no Mrs. Quest, he would stake his
      fortune upon the hazard of the die, aye, and win, even if he loaded the
      dice.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was still thinking thus, standing at his window and gazing out on
      to the market place of the quiet little town, he suddenly saw Ida herself
      driving in her pony-carriage. It was a wet and windy day, the rain was on
      her cheek, and the wind tossed a little lock of her brown hair. The cob
      was pulling, and her proud face was set, as she concentrated her energies
      upon holding him. Never to Edward Cossey had she looked more beautiful.
      His heart beat fast at the sight of her, and whatever doubts might have
      lingered in his mind, vanished. Yes, he would claim her promise and marry
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the pony carriage pulled up at his door, and the boy who was
      sitting behind got down and rang the bell. He stepped back from the
      window, wondering what it could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you please give that note to Mr. Cossey,&rdquo; said Ida, as
      the door opened, &ldquo;and ask him to send an answer?&rdquo; and she was
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The note was from the Squire, sealed with his big seal (the Squire always
      sealed his letters in the old-fashioned way), and contained an invitation
      to himself to shoot on the morrow. &ldquo;George wants me to do a little
      partridge driving,&rdquo; it ended, &ldquo;and to brush through one or two
      of the small coverts. There will only be Colonel Quaritch besides yourself
      and George, but I hope that you will have a fair rough day. If I don&rsquo;t
      hear from you I shall suppose that you are coming, so don&rsquo;t trouble
      to write.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I will go,&rdquo; said Edward. &ldquo;Confound that
      Quaritch. At any rate I can show him how to shoot, and what is more I will
      have it out with him about my aunt.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. &mdash; THE COLONEL GOES OUT SHOOTING
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning was fine and still, one of those lovely autumn days of
      which we get four or five in the course of a season. After breakfast
      Harold Quaritch strolled down his garden, stood himself against a gate to
      the right of Dead Man&rsquo;s Mount, and looked at the scene. All about
      him, their foliage yellowing to its fall, rose the giant oaks, which were
      the pride of the country side, and so quiet was the air that not a leaf
      upon them stirred. The only sounds that reached his ears were the tappings
      of the nut-hutches as they sought their food in the rough crannies of the
      bark, and the occasional falling of a rich ripe acorn from its lofty place
      on to the frosted grass beneath. The sunshine shone bright, but with a
      chastened heat, the squirrels scrambled up the oaks, and high in the blue
      air the rooks pursued their path. It was a beautiful morning, for summer
      is never more sweet than on its death-bed, and yet it filled him with
      solemn thoughts. How many autumns had those old trees seen, and how many
      would they still see, long after his eyes had lost their sight! And if
      they were old, how old was Dead Man&rsquo;s Mount there to his left! Old,
      indeed! for he had discovered it was mentioned in Doomday Book and by that
      name. And what was it&mdash;a boundary hill, a natural formation, or, as
      its name implied, a funeral barrow? He had half a mind to dig one day and
      find out, that is if he could get anybody to dig with him, for the people
      about Honham were so firmly convinced that Dead Man&rsquo;s Mount was
      haunted, a reputation which it had owned from time immemorial, that
      nothing would have persuaded them to touch it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He contemplated the great mound carefully without coming to any
      conclusion, and then looked at his watch. It was a quarter to ten, time
      for him to start for the Castle for his day&rsquo;s shooting. So he got
      his gun and cartridges, and in due course arrived at the Castle, to find
      George and several myrmidons, in the shape of beaters and boys, already
      standing in the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, Colonel, the Squire hopes you&rsquo;ll go in and have a
      glass of summut before you start,&rdquo; said George; so accordingly he
      went, not to &ldquo;have a glass of summut,&rdquo; but on the chance of
      seeing Ida. In the vestibule he found the old gentleman busily engaged in
      writing an enormous letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, Colonel,&rdquo; he halloaed, without getting up, &ldquo;glad
      to see you. Excuse me for a few moments, will you, I want to get this off
      my mind. Ida! Ida! Ida!&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s Colonel
      Quaritch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious, father,&rdquo; said that young lady, arriving in a
      hurry, &ldquo;you are bringing the house down,&rdquo; and then she turned
      round and greeted Harold. It was the first time they had met since the
      eventful evening described a chapter or two back, so the occasion might be
      considered a little awkward; at any rate he felt it so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Colonel Quaritch?&rdquo; she said quite simply,
      giving him her hand. There was nothing in the words, and yet he felt that
      he was very welcome. For when a woman really loves a man there is about
      her an atmosphere of softness and tender meaning which can scarcely be
      mistaken. Sometimes it is only perceptible to the favoured individual
      himself, but more generally is to be discerned by any person of ordinary
      shrewdness. A very short course of observation in general society will
      convince the reader of the justice of this observation, and when once he
      gets to know the signs of the weather he will probably light upon more
      affairs of the heart than were ever meant for his investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This softness, or atmospheric influence, or subdued glow of affection
      radiating from a light within, was clearly enough visible in Ida that
      morning, and certainly it made our friend the Colonel unspeakably happy to
      see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you fond of shooting?&rdquo; she asked presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very, and have been all my life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a good shot?&rdquo; she asked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call that a rude question,&rdquo; he answered smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is, but I want to know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Harold, &ldquo;I suppose that I am pretty fair,
      that is at rough shooting; I never had much practice at driven birds and
      that kind of sport.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it does not much matter. One goes out shooting for the sport
      of the thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know, but Mr. Edward Cossey,&rdquo; and she shrank visibly
      as she uttered the name, &ldquo;is coming, and he is a <i>very</i> good
      shot and <i>very</i> conceited about it. I want you to beat him if you can&mdash;will
      you try?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Harold, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t at all like shooting
      against a man. It is not sportsmanlike, you know; and, besides, if Mr.
      Cossey is a crack shot, I daresay that I shall be nowhere; but I will
      shoot as well as I can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, it is very feminine, but I would give anything to see
      you beat him?&rdquo; and she nodded and laughed, whereupon Harold Quaritch
      vowed in his heart that if it in him lay he would not disappoint her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Edward Cossey&rsquo;s fast trotting horse drew up at the
      door with a prodigious crunching of gravel, and Edward himself entered,
      looking very handsome and rather pale. He was admirably dressed, that is
      to say, his shooting clothes were beautifully made and very new-looking,
      and so were his boots, and so was his hat, and so were his hammerless
      guns, of which he brought a pair. There exists a certain class of
      sportsmen who always appear to have just walked out of a sporting tailor&rsquo;s
      shop, and to this class Edward Cossey belonged. Everything about him was
      of the best and newest and most expensive kind possible; even his guns
      were just down from a famous maker, and the best that could be had for
      love or money, having cost exactly a hundred and forty guineas the pair.
      Indeed, he presented a curious contrast to his rival. The Colonel had
      certainly nothing new-looking about <i>him</i>; an old tweed coat, an old
      hat, with a piece of gut still twined round it, a sadly frayed bag full of
      brown cartridges, and, last of all, an old gun with the brown worn off the
      barrels, original cost, 17 pounds 10s. And yet there was no possibility of
      making any mistake as to which of the two looked more of a gentleman, or,
      indeed, more of a sportsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward Cossey shook hands with Ida, but when the Colonel was advancing to
      give him his hand, he turned and spoke to the Squire, who had at length
      finished his letter, so that no greeting was passed between them. At the
      time Harold did not know if this move was or was not accidental.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently they started, Edward Cossey attended by his man with the second
      gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo! Cossey,&rdquo; sang out the Squire after him, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t
      any use bringing your two guns for this sort of work. I don&rsquo;t
      preserve much here, you know, at least not now. You will only get a dozen
      cock pheasants and a few brace of partridges.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I always like to have a
      second gun in case I should want it. It&rsquo;s no trouble, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the Squire. &ldquo;Ida and I will come down
      with the luncheon to the grove. Good-bye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After crossing the moat, Edward Cossey walked by himself, followed by his
      man and a very fine retriever, and the Colonel talked to George, who was
      informing him that Mr. Cossey was &ldquo;a pretty shot, he wore, but
      rather snappy over it,&rdquo; till they came to a field of white turnips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, gentlemen, if you please,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;we will
      walk through these here turnips. I put two coveys of birds in here myself,
      and it&rsquo;s rare good &lsquo;lay&rsquo; for them; so I think that we
      had better see if they will let us come nigh them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly they started down the field, the Colonel on the right, George
      in the middle and Edward Cossey on the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before they had gone ten yards, an old Frenchman got up in the front of
      one of the beaters and wheeled round past Edward, who cut him over in
      first-rate style.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that one bird the Colonel could see that the man was a quick and
      clever shot. Presently, however, a leash of English birds rose rather
      awkwardly at about forty paces straight in front of Edward Cossey, and
      Harold noticed that he left them alone, never attempting to fire at them.
      In fact he was one of those shooters who never take a hard shot if they
      can avoid it, being always in terror lest they should miss it and so
      reduce their average.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then George, who was a very fair shot of the &ldquo;poking&rdquo; order,
      fired both barrels and got a bird, and Edward Cossey got another. It was
      not till they were getting to the end of their last beat that Harold found
      a chance of letting off his gun. Suddenly, however, a brace of old birds
      sprang up out of the turnips in front of him at about thirty yards as
      swiftly as though they had been ejected from a mortar, and made off, one
      to the right and one to the left, both of them rising shots. He got the
      right-hand bird, and then turning killed the other also, when it was more
      than fifty yards away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel felt satisfied, for the shots were very good. Mr. Cossey
      opened his eyes and wondered if it was a fluke, and George ejaculated,
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a master one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After this they pursued their course, picking up another two brace of
      birds on the way to the outlying cover, a wood of about twenty acres
      through which they were to brush. It was a good holding wood for
      pheasants, but lay on the outside of the Honham estate, where they were
      liable to be poached by the farmers whose land marched, so George enjoined
      them particularly not to let anything go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into the details of the sport that followed we need not enter, beyond
      saying that the Colonel, to his huge delight, never shot better in his
      life. Indeed, with the exception of one rabbit and hen pheasant that
      flopped up right beneath his feet, he scarcely missed anything, though he
      took the shots as they came. Edward Cossey also shot well, and with one
      exception missed nothing, but then he never took a difficult shot if he
      could avoid it. The exception was a woodcock which rose in front of
      George, who was walking down an outside belt with the beaters. He loosed
      two barrels at it and missed, and on it came among the tree tops, past
      where Edward Cossey was standing, about half-way down the belt, giving him
      a difficult chance with the first barrel and a clear one with the second.
      Bang! bang! and on came the woodcock, now flying low, but at tremendous
      speed, straight at the Colonel&rsquo;s head, a most puzzling shot.
      However, he fired, and to his joy (and what joy is there like to the joy
      of a sportsman who has just killed a woodcock which everybody has been
      popping at?) down it came with a thump almost at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was their last beat before lunch, which was now to be seen
      approaching down a lane in a donkey cart convoyed by Ida and the Squire.
      The latter was advancing in stages of about ten paces, and at every stage
      he stopped to utter a most fearful roar by way of warning all and sundry
      that they were not to shoot in his direction. Edward gave his gun to his
      bearer and at once walked off to join them, but the Colonel went with
      George to look after two running cocks which he had down, for he was an
      old-fashioned sportsman, and hated not picking up his game. After some
      difficulty they found one of the cocks in the hedgerow, but the other they
      could not find, so reluctantly they gave up the search. When they got to
      the lane they found the luncheon ready, while one of the beaters was
      laying out the game for the Squire to inspect. There were fourteen
      pheasants, four brace and a half of partridges, a hare, three rabbits, and
      a woodcock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo,&rdquo; said the Squire, &ldquo;who shot the woodcock?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;we all had a pull at him, but
      the Colonel wiped our eyes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Cossey,&rdquo; said Ida, in affected surprise, &ldquo;why,
      I thought you never missed <i>anything</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody misses sometimes,&rdquo; answered that gentleman, looking
      uncommonly sulky. &ldquo;I shall do better this afternoon when it comes to
      the driven partridges.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you will,&rdquo; went on Ida, laughing
      maliciously. &ldquo;I bet you a pair of gloves that Colonel Quaritch will
      shoot more driven partridges than you do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done,&rdquo; said Edward Cossey sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, do you hear that, Colonel Quaritch?&rdquo; went on Ida.
      &ldquo;I have bet Mr. Cossey a pair of gloves that you will kill more
      partridges this afternoon than he will, so I hope you won&rsquo;t make me
      lose them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness gracious,&rdquo; said the Colonel, in much alarm. &ldquo;Why,
      the last partridge-driving that I had was on the slopes of some mountains
      in Afghanistan. I daresay that I shan&rsquo;t hit anything. Besides,&rdquo;
      he said with some irritation, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like being set up to
      shoot against people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; said Edward loftily, &ldquo;if Colonel
      Quaritch does not like to take it up there&rsquo;s an end of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Colonel, &ldquo;if you put it in that way I
      don&rsquo;t mind trying, but I have only one gun and you have two.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that will be all right,&rdquo; said Ida to the Colonel. &ldquo;You
      shall have George&rsquo;s gun; he never tries to shoot when they drive
      partridges, because he cannot hit them. He goes with the beaters. It is a
      very good gun.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel took up the gun and examined it. It was of about the same bend
      and length as his own, but of a better quality, having once been the
      property of James de la Molle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but then I haven&rsquo;t got a loader.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind. I&rsquo;ll do that, I know all about it. I often used
      to hold my brother&rsquo;s second gun when we drove partridges, because he
      said I was so much quicker than the men. Look,&rdquo; and she took the gun
      and rested one knee on the turf; &ldquo;first position, second position,
      third position. We used to have regular drills at it,&rdquo; and she
      sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel laughed heartily, for it was a curious thing to see this
      stately woman handling a gun with all the skill and quickness of a
      practised shot. Besides, as the loader idea involved a whole afternoon of
      Ida&rsquo;s society he certainly was not inclined to negative it. But
      Edward Cossey did not smile; on the contrary he positively scowled with
      jealousy, and was about to make some remark when Ida held up her finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;here comes my father&rdquo; (the
      Squire had been counting the game); &ldquo;he hates bets, so you mustn&rsquo;t
      say anything about our match.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Luncheon went off pretty well, though Edward Cossey did not contribute
      much to the general conversation. When it was done the Squire announced
      that he was going to walk to the other end of the estate, whereon Ida said
      that she should stop and see something of the shooting, and the fun began.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. &mdash; THE END OF THE MATCH
    </h2>
    <p>
      They began the afternoon with several small drives, but on the whole the
      birds did very badly. They broke back, went off to one side or the other,
      and generally misbehaved themselves. In the first drive the Colonel and
      Edward Cossey got a bird each. In the second drive the latter got three
      birds, firing five shots, and his antagonist only got a hare and a
      pheasant that jumped out of a ditch, neither of which, of course, counted
      anything. Only one brace of birds came his way at all, but if the truth
      must be told, he was talking to Ida at the moment and did not see them
      till too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came a longer drive, when the birds were pretty plentiful. The
      Colonel got one, a low-flying Frenchman, which he killed as he topped the
      fence, and after that for the life of him he could not touch a feather.
      Every sportsman knows what a fatal thing it is to begin to miss and then
      get nervous, and that was what happened to the Colonel. Continually there
      came distant cries of &ldquo;<i>Mark! mark over!</i>&rdquo; followed by
      the apparition of half-a-dozen brown balls showing clearly against the
      grey autumn sky and sweeping down towards him like lightning. <i>Whizz</i>
      in front, overhead and behind; bang, bang; bang again with the second gun,
      and they were away&mdash;vanished, gone, leaving nothing but a memory
      behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel swore beneath his breath, and Ida kneeling at his side, sighed
      audibly; but it was of no use, and presently the drive was done, and there
      he was with one wretched French partridge to show for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida said nothing, but she looked volumes, and if ever a man felt
      humiliated, Harold Quaritch was that man. She had set her heart upon his
      winning the match, and he was making an exhibition of himself that might
      have caused a schoolboy to blush.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only Edward Cossey smiled grimly as he told his bearer to give the two and
      a half brace which he had shot to George.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last drive this next, gentlemen,&rdquo; said that universal
      functionary as he surveyed the Colonel&rsquo;s one Frenchman, and then
      glancing sadly at the tell-tale pile of empty cartridge cases, added,
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hev to shoot up, Colonel, this time, if you are
      a-going to win them there gloves for Miss Ida. Mr. Cossey hev knocked up
      four brace and a half, and you hev only got a brace. Look you here, sir,&rdquo;
      he went on in a portentous whisper, &ldquo;keep forrard of them, well
      forrard, fire ahead, and down they&rsquo;ll come of themselves like. You&rsquo;re
      a better shot than he is a long way; you could give him &lsquo;birds,&rsquo;
      sir, that you could, and beat him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold said nothing. He was sorely tempted to make excuses, as any man
      would have been, and he might with truth have urged that he was not
      accustomed to partridge-driving, and that one of the guns was new to him.
      But he resisted manfully and said never a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      George placed the two guns, and then went off to join the beaters. It was
      a capital spot for a drive, for on each side were young larch plantations,
      sloping down towards them like a V, the guns being at the narrow end and
      level with the points of the plantations, which were at this spot about a
      hundred and twenty yards apart. In front was a large stretch of open
      fields, lying in such a fashion that the birds were bound to fly straight
      over the guns and between the gap at the end of the V-shaped covers.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had to wait a long while, for the beat was of considerable extent,
      and this they did in silence, till presently a couple of single birds
      appeared coming down the wind like lightning, for a stiffish breeze had
      sprung up. One went to the left over Edward Cossey&rsquo;s head, and he
      shot it very neatly, but the other, catching sight of Harold&rsquo;s hat
      beneath the fence, which was not a high one, swerved and crossed, an
      almost impossible shot, nearer sixty than fifty yards from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Ida, and he fired, and to his joy down came the
      bird with a thud, bounding full two feet into the air with the force of
      its impact, being indeed shot through the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; said Ida, as she handed him the second
      gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another moment and a covey came over, high up. He fired both barrels and
      got a right and left, and snatching the second gun sent another barrel
      after them, hitting a third bird, which did not fall. And then a noble
      enthusiasm and certainty possessed him, and he knew that he should miss no
      more. Nor did he. With two almost impossible exceptions he dropped every
      bird that drive. But his crowning glory, a thing whereof he still often
      dreams, was yet to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had killed four brace of partridge and fired eleven times, when at last
      the beaters made their appearance about two hundred yards away at the
      further end of rather dirty barley stubble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that is the lot,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
      you have lost your gloves, Ida.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely were the words out of his mouth when there was a yell of &ldquo;mark!&rdquo;
      and a strong covey of birds appeared, swooping down the wind right on to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On they came, scattered and rather &ldquo;stringy.&rdquo; Harold gripped
      his gun and drew a deep breath, while Ida, kneeling at his side, her lips
      apart, and her beautiful eyes wide open, watched their advent through a
      space in the hedge. Lovely enough she looked to charm the heart of any
      man, if a man out partridge-driving could descend to such frivolity, which
      we hold to be impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now is the moment. The leading brace are something over fifty yards away,
      and he knows full well that if there is to be a chance left for the second
      gun he must shoot before they are five yards nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bang!&rdquo; down comes the old cock bird; &ldquo;bang!&rdquo; and
      his mate follows him, falling with a smash into the fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quick as light Ida takes the empty gun with one hand, and as he swings
      round passes him the cocked and loaded one with the other. &ldquo;Bang!&rdquo;
      Another bird topples head first out of the thinned covey. They are nearly
      sixty yards away now. &ldquo;Bang!&rdquo; again, and oh, joy and wonder!
      the last bird turns right over backwards, and falls dead as a stone some
      seventy paces from the muzzle of the gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had killed four birds out of a single driven covey, which as shooters
      well know is a feat not often done even by the best driving shots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; said Ida, &ldquo;I was sure that you could shoot if
      you chose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;it was pretty good work;&rdquo; and
      he commenced collecting the birds, for by this time the beaters were
      across the field. They were all dead, not a runner in the lot, and there
      were exactly six brace of them. Just as he picked up the last, George
      arrived, followed by Edward Cossey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well I niver,&rdquo; said the former, while something resembling a
      smile stole over his melancholy countenance, &ldquo;if that bean&rsquo;t
      the masterest bit of shooting that ever I did see. Lord Walsingham couldn&rsquo;t
      hardly beat that hisself&mdash;fifteen empty cases and twelve birds picked
      up. Why,&rdquo; and he turned to Edward, &ldquo;bless me, sir, if I don&rsquo;t
      believe the Colonel has won them gloves for Miss Ida after all. Let&rsquo;s
      see, sir, you got two brace this last drive and one the first, and a leash
      the second, and two brace and a half the third, six and a half brace in
      all. And the Colonel, yes, he hev seven brace, one bird to the good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Mr. Cossey,&rdquo; said Ida, smiling sweetly, &ldquo;I have
      won my gloves. Mind you don&rsquo;t forget to pay them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I will not forget, Miss de la Molle,&rdquo; said he, smiling
      also, but not too prettily. &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he said, addressing
      the Colonel, &ldquo;that the last covey twisted up and you browned them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered quietly, &ldquo;all four were clear shots.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cossey smiled again, as he turned away to hide his vexation, an
      incredulous smile, which somehow sent Harold Quaritch&rsquo;s blood
      leaping through his veins more quickly than was good for him. Edward
      Cossey would rather have lost a thousand pounds than that his adversary
      should have got that extra bird, for not only was he a jealous shot, but
      he knew perfectly well that Ida was anxious that he should lose, and
      desired above all things to see him humiliated. And then he, the smartest
      shot within ten miles round, to be beaten by a middle-aged soldier
      shooting with a strange gun, and totally unaccustomed to driven birds!
      Why, the story would be told over the county; George would see to that.
      His anger was so great when he thought of it, that afraid of making
      himself ridiculous, he set off with his bearer towards the Castle without
      another word, leaving the others to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida looked after him and smiled. &ldquo;He is so conceited,&rdquo; she
      said; &ldquo;he cannot bear to be beaten at anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that you are rather hard on him,&rdquo; said the Colonel,
      for the joke had an unpleasant side which jarred upon his taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; she answered, with a little stamp, &ldquo;it is
      not for you to say so. If you disliked him as much as I do you would be
      hard on him, too. Besides, I daresay that his turn is coming.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel winced, as well he might, but looking at her handsome face,
      set just now like steel at the thought of what the future might bring
      forth, he reflected that if Edward Cossey&rsquo;s turn did come he was by
      no means sure that the ultimate triumph would rest with him. Ida de la
      Molle, to whatever extent her sense of honour and money indebtedness might
      carry her, was no butterfly to be broken on a wheel, but a woman whose
      dislike and anger, or worse still, whose cold, unvarying disdain, was a
      thing from which the boldest hearted man might shrink aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing more was said on the subject, and they began to talk, though
      somewhat constrainedly, about indifferent matters. They were both aware
      that it was a farce, and that they were playing a part, for beneath the
      external ice of formalities the river of their devotion ran strong&mdash;whither
      they knew not. All that had been made clear a few nights back. But what
      will you have? Necessity over-riding their desires, compelled them along
      the path of self-denial, and, like wise folk, they recognised the fact:
      for there is nothing more painful in the world than the outburst of
      hopeless affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so they talked about painting and shooting and what not, till they
      reached the grey old Castle towers. Here Harold wanted to bid her
      good-bye, but she persuaded him to come in and have some tea, saying that
      her father would like to say good-night to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly he went into the vestibule, where there was a light, for it
      was getting dusk; and here he found the Squire and Mr. Cossey. As soon as
      he entered, Edward Cossey rose, said good-night to the Squire and Ida, and
      then passed towards the door, where the Colonel was standing, rubbing the
      mud off his shooting boots. As he came, Harold being slightly ashamed of
      the business of the shooting match, and very sorry to have humiliated a
      man who prided himself so much upon his skill in a particular branch of
      sport, held out his hand and said in a friendly tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Mr. Cossey. Next time that we are out shooting together
      I expect I shall be nowhere. It was an awful fluke of mine killing those
      four birds.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward Cossey took no notice of the friendly words or outstretched hand,
      but came straight on as though he intended to walk past him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel was wondering what it was best to do, for he could not mistake
      the meaning of the oversight, when the Squire, who was sometimes very
      quick to notice things, spoke in a loud and decided tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Cossey,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Colonel Quaritch is offering you
      his hand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I observe that he is,&rdquo; he answered, setting his handsome
      face, &ldquo;but I do not wish to take Colonel Quaritch&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came a moment&rsquo;s silence, which the Squire again broke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When a gentleman in my house refuses to take the hand of another
      gentleman,&rdquo; he said very quietly, &ldquo;I think that I have a right
      to ask the reason for his conduct, which, unless that reason is a very
      sufficient one, is almost as much a slight upon me as upon him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that Colonel Quaritch must know the reason, and will not
      press me to explain,&rdquo; said Edward Cossey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know of no reason,&rdquo; replied the Colonel sternly, &ldquo;unless
      indeed it is that I have been so unfortunate as to get the best of Mr.
      Cossey in a friendly shooting match.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel Quaritch must know well that this is not the reason to
      which I allude,&rdquo; said Edward. &ldquo;If he consults his conscience
      he will probably discover a better one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida and her father looked at each other in surprise, while the Colonel by
      a half involuntary movement stepped between his accuser and the door; and
      Ida noticed that his face was white with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have made a very serious implication against me, Mr. Cossey,&rdquo;
      he said in a cold clear voice. &ldquo;Before you leave this room you will
      be so good as to explain it in the presence of those before whom it has
      been made.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, if you wish it,&rdquo; he answered, with something like
      a sneer. &ldquo;The reason why I refused to take your hand, Colonel
      Quaritch, is that you have been guilty of conduct which proves to me that
      you are not a gentleman, and, therefore, not a person with whom I desire
      to be on friendly terms. Shall I go on?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly you will go on,&rdquo; answered the Colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. The conduct to which I refer is that you were once
      engaged to my aunt, Julia Heston; that within three days of the time of
      the marriage you deserted and jilted her in a most cruel way, as a
      consequence of which she went mad, and is to this moment an inmate of an
      asylum.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida gave an exclamation of astonishment, and the Colonel started, while
      the Squire, looking at him curiously, waited to hear what he had to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is perfectly true, Mr. Cossey,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;that I
      was engaged twenty years ago to be married to Miss Julia Heston, though I
      now for the first time learn that she was your aunt. It is also quite true
      that that engagement was broken off, under most painful circumstances,
      within three days of the time fixed for the marriage. What those
      circumstances were I am not at liberty to say, for the simple reason that
      I gave my word not to do so; but this I will say, that they were not to my
      discredit, though you may not be aware of that fact. But as you are one of
      the family, Mr. Cossey, my tongue is not tied, and I will do myself the
      honour of calling upon you to-morrow and explaining them to you. After
      that,&rdquo; he added significantly, &ldquo;I shall require you to
      apologise to me as publicly as you have accused me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may require, but whether I shall comply is another matter,&rdquo;
      said Edward Cossey, and he passed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry, Mr. de la Molle,&rdquo; said the Colonel, as soon
      as he had gone, &ldquo;more sorry than I can say, that I should have been
      the cause of this most unpleasant scene. I also feel that I am placed in a
      very false position, and until I produce Mr. Cossey&rsquo;s written
      apology, that position must to some extent continue. If I fail to obtain
      that apology, I shall have to consider what course to take. In the
      meanwhile I can only ask you to suspend your judgment.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. &mdash; THE BLOW FALLS
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the following morning, about ten o&rsquo;clock, while Edward Cossey was
      still at breakfast, a dog-cart drew up at his door and out of it stepped
      Colonel Quaritch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for the row,&rdquo; said he to himself. &ldquo;I hope that the
      governor was right in his tale, that&rsquo;s all. Perhaps it would have
      been wiser to say nothing till I had made sure,&rdquo; and he poured out
      some more tea a little nervously, for in the Colonel he had, he felt, an
      adversary not to be despised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the door opened, and &ldquo;Colonel Quaritch&rdquo; was
      announced. He rose and bowed a salutation, which the Colonel whose face
      bore a particularly grim expression, did not return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you take a chair?&rdquo; he said, as soon as the servant had
      left, and without speaking Harold took one&mdash;and presently began the
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last night, Mr. Cossey,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you thought proper
      to publicly bring a charge against me, which if it were true would go a
      long way towards showing that I was not a fit person to associate with
      those before whom it was brought.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Edward coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before making any remarks on your conduct in bringing such a
      charge, which I give you credit for believing to be true, I purpose to
      show to you that it is a false charge,&rdquo; went on the Colonel quietly.
      &ldquo;The story is a very simple one, and so sad that nothing short of
      necessity would force me to tell it. I was, when quite young, engaged to
      your aunt, Miss Heston, to whom I was much attached, and who was then
      twenty years of age. Though I had little besides my profession, she had
      money, and we were going to be married. The circumstances under which the
      marriage was broken off were as follow:&mdash;Three days before the
      wedding was to take place I went unexpectedly to the house, and was told
      by the servant that Miss Heston was upstairs in her sitting-room. I went
      upstairs to the room, which I knew well, knocked and got no answer. Then I
      walked into the room, and this is what I saw. Your aunt was lying on the
      sofa in her wedding dress (that is, in half of it, for she had only the
      skirt on), as I first thought, asleep. I went up to her, and saw that by
      her side was a brandy bottle, half empty. In her hand also was a glass
      containing raw brandy. While I was wondering what it could mean, she woke
      up, got off the sofa, and I saw that she was intoxicated.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo; said Edward excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be careful what you say, sir,&rdquo; answered the Colonel, &ldquo;and
      wait to say it till I have done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as I realised what was the matter, I left the room again,
      and going down to your grandfather&rsquo;s study, where he was engaged in
      writing a sermon, I asked him to come upstairs, as I feared that his
      daughter was not well. He came and saw, and the sight threw him off his
      balance, for he broke out into a torrent of explanations and excuses, from
      which in time I extracted the following facts:&mdash;It appeared that ever
      since she was a child, Miss Heston had been addicted to drinking fits, and
      that it was on account of this constitutional weakness, which was of
      course concealed from me, that she had been allowed to engage herself to a
      penniless subaltern. It appeared, too, that the habit was hereditary, for
      her mother had died from the effects of drink, and one of her aunts had
      become mad from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went away and thought the matter over, and came to the conclusion
      that under these circumstances it would be impossible for me, much as I
      was attached to your aunt, to marry her, because even if I were willing to
      do so, I had no right to run the risk of bringing children into the world
      who might inherit the curse. Having come to this determination, which it
      cost me much to do, I wrote and communicated it to your grandfather, and
      the marriage was broken off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not believe it, I do not believe a word of it,&rdquo; said
      Edward, jumping up. &ldquo;You jilted her and drove her mad, and now you
      are trying to shelter yourself behind a tissue of falsehood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you acquainted with your grandfather&rsquo;s handwriting?&rdquo;
      asked the Colonel quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that it?&rdquo; he went on, producing a yellow-looking letter
      and showing it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe so&mdash;at least it looks like it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then read the letter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward obeyed. It was one written in answer to that of Harold Quaritch to
      his betrothed&rsquo;s father, and admitted in the clearest terms the
      justice of the step that he had taken. Further, it begged him for the sake
      of Julia and the family at large, never to mention the cause of his
      defection to any one outside the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you satisfied, Mr. Cossey? I have other letters, if you wish to
      see them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward made no reply, and the Colonel went on:&mdash;&ldquo;I gave the
      promise your grandfather asked for, and in spite of the remarks that were
      freely made upon my behaviour, I kept it, as it was my duty to do. You,
      Mr. Cossey, are the first person to whom the story has been told. And now
      that you have thought fit to make accusations against me, which are
      without foundation, I must ask you to retract them as fully as you made
      them. I have prepared a letter which you will be so good as to sign,&rdquo;
      and he handed him a note addressed to the Squire. It ran:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Mr. de la Molle,&mdash; &ldquo;I beg in the fullest and most
      ample manner possible to retract the charges which I made yesterday
      evening against Colonel Quaritch, in the presence of yourself and Miss de
      la Molle. I find that those charges were unfounded, and I hereby apologise
      to Colonel Quaritch for having made them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And supposing that I refuse to sign,&rdquo; said Edward sulkily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think,&rdquo; answered the Colonel, &ldquo;that you will
      refuse.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward looked at Colonel Quaritch, and the Colonel looked at Edward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Colonel, &ldquo;please understand I mean that
      you should sign this letter, and, indeed, seeing how absolutely you are in
      the wrong, I do not think that you can hesitate to do so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then very slowly and unwillingly, Edward Cossey took up a pen, affixed his
      signature to the letter, blotted it, and pushed it from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel folded it up, placed it in an envelope which he had ready, and
      put it in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Cossey,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will wish you
      good-morning. Another time I should recommend you to be more careful, both
      of your facts and the manner of your accusations,&rdquo; and with a slight
      bow he left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curse the fellow,&rdquo; thought Edward to himself as the front
      door closed, &ldquo;he had me there&mdash;I was forced to sign. Well, I
      will be even with him about Ida, at any rate. I will propose to her this
      very day, Belle or no Belle, and if she won&rsquo;t have me I will call
      the money in and smash the whole thing up&rdquo;&mdash;and his handsome
      face bore a very evil look, as he thought of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      That very afternoon he started in pursuance of this design, to pay a visit
      to the Castle. The Squire was out, but Miss de la Molle was at home. He
      was ushered into the drawing-room, where Ida was working, for it was a wet
      and windy afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose to greet him coldly enough, and he sat down, and then came a
      pause which she did not seem inclined to break.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he spoke. &ldquo;Did the Squire get my letter, Miss de la Molle?&rdquo;
      he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, rather icily. &ldquo;Colonel Quaritch
      sent it up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; he added confusedly, &ldquo;that I should
      have put myself in such a false position. I hope that you will give me
      credit for having believed my accusation when I made it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such accusations should not be lightly made, Mr. Cossey,&rdquo; was
      her answer, and, as though to turn the subject, she rose and rang the bell
      for tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came, and the bustle connected with it prevented any further
      conversation for a while. At length, however, it subsided, and once more
      Edward found himself alone with Ida. He looked at her and felt afraid. The
      woman was of a different clay to himself, and he knew it&mdash;he loved
      her, but he did not understand her in the least. However, if the thing was
      to be done at all it must be done now, so, with a desperate effort, he
      brought himself to the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss de la Molle,&rdquo; he said, and Ida, knowing full surely what
      was coming, felt her heart jump within her bosom and then stand still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss de la Molle,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;perhaps you will
      remember a conversation that passed between us some weeks ago in the
      conservatory?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I remember&mdash;about the money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the money and other things,&rdquo; he said, gathering
      courage. &ldquo;I hinted to you then that I hoped in certain contingencies
      to be allowed to make my addresses to you, and I think that you understood
      me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understood you perfectly,&rdquo; answered Ida, her pale face set
      like ice, &ldquo;and I gave you to understand that in the event of your
      lending my father the money, I should hold myself bound to&mdash;to listen
      to what you had to say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, never mind the money,&rdquo; broke in Edward. &ldquo;It is not
      a question of money with me, Ida, it is not, indeed. I love you with all
      my heart. I have loved you ever since I saw you. It was because I was
      jealous of him that I made a fool of myself last night with Colonel
      Quaritch. I should have asked you to marry me long ago only there were
      obstacles in the way. I love you, Ida; there never was a woman like you&mdash;never.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She listened with the same set face. Obviously he was in earnest, but his
      earnestness did not move her; it scarcely even flattered her pride. She
      disliked the man intensely, and nothing that he could say or do would
      lessen that dislike by one jot&mdash;probably, indeed, it would only
      intensify it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he stopped, his breast heaving and his face broken with emotion,
      and tried to take her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She withdrew it sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think that there is any need for all this,&rdquo; she said
      coldly. &ldquo;I gave a conditional promise. You have fulfilled your share
      of the bargain, and I am prepared to fulfil mine in due course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So far as her words went, Edward could find no fault with their meaning,
      and yet he felt more like a man who has been abruptly and finally refused
      than one declared chosen. He stood still and looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it right to tell you, however,&rdquo; she went on in the
      same measured tones, &ldquo;that if I marry you it will be from motives of
      duty, and not from motives of affection. I have no love to give you and I
      do not wish for yours. I do not know if you will be satisfied with this.
      If you are not, you had better give up the idea,&rdquo; and for the first
      time she looked up at him with more anxiety in her face than she would
      have cared to show.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if she hoped that her coldness would repel him, she was destined to be
      disappointed. On the contrary, like water thrown on burning oil, it only
      inflamed him the more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The love will come, Ida,&rdquo; he said, and once more he tried to
      take her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr. Cossey,&rdquo; she said, in a voice that checked him.
      &ldquo;I am sorry to have to speak so plainly, but till I marry I am my
      own mistress. Pray understand me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you like,&rdquo; he said, drawing back from her sulkily. &ldquo;I
      am so fond of you that I will marry you on any terms, and that is the
      truth. I have, however, one thing to ask of you, Ida, and it is that you
      will keep our engagement secret for the present, and get your father (I
      suppose I must speak to him) to do the same. I have reasons,&rdquo; he
      went on by way of explanation, &ldquo;for not wishing it to become known.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not see why I should keep it secret,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but
      it does not matter to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;my father is a very
      curious man, and I doubt if he would like my engagement, because he thinks
      I ought to marry a great deal of money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, indeed,&rdquo; answered Ida. She had believed, as was indeed
      the case, that there were other reasons not unconnected with Mrs. Quest,
      on account of which he was anxious to keep the engagement secret. &ldquo;By
      the way,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;I am sorry to have to talk of
      business, but this is a business matter, is it not? I suppose it is
      understood that, in the event of our marriage, the mortgage you hold over
      this place will not be enforced against my father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Look here, Ida, I will
      give you those mortgage bonds as a wedding present, and you can put them
      in the fire; and I will make a good settlement on you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I do not require any
      settlement on myself; I had rather none was made; but I consent to the
      engagement only on the express condition that the mortgages shall be
      cancelled before marriage, and as the property will ultimately come to me,
      this is not much to ask. And now one more thing, Mr. Cossey; I should like
      to know when you would wish this marriage to take place; not yet, I
      presume?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could wish it to take place to-morrow,&rdquo; he said with an
      attempt at a laugh; &ldquo;but I suppose that between one thing and
      another it can&rsquo;t come off at once. Shall we say this time six
      months, that will be in May?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Ida; &ldquo;this day six months I shall be
      prepared to become your wife, Mr. Cossey. I believe,&rdquo; she added with
      a flash of bitter sarcasm, &ldquo;it is the time usually allowed for the
      redemption of a mortgage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say very hard things,&rdquo; he answered, wincing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I? I daresay. I am hard by nature. I wonder that you can wish to
      marry me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish it beyond everything in the world,&rdquo; he answered
      earnestly. &ldquo;You can never know how much. By the way, I know I was
      foolish about Colonel Quaritch; but, Ida, I cannot bear to see that man
      near you. I hope that you will now drop his acquaintance as much as
      possible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more Ida&rsquo;s face set like a flint. &ldquo;I am not your wife
      yet, Mr. Cossey,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;when I am you will have a right
      to dictate to me as to whom I shall associate with. At present you have no
      such right, and if it pleases me to associate with Colonel Quaritch, I
      shall do so. If you disapprove of my conduct, the remedy is simple&mdash;you
      can break off the engagement.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose absolutely crushed, for Ida was by far the stronger of the two,
      and besides, his passion gave her an unfair advantage over him. Without
      attempting a reply he held out his hand and said good-night, for he was
      afraid to venture on any demonstration of affection, adding that he would
      come to see her father in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      She touched his outstretched hand with her fingers, and then fearing lest
      he should change his mind, promptly rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another minute the door had closed behind him and she was left alone.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV. &mdash; &ldquo;GOOD-BYE, MY DEAR, GOOD-BYE!&rdquo;
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Edward Cossey had gone, Ida rose and put her hands to her head. So
      the blow had fallen, the deed was done, and she was engaged to be married
      to Edward Cossey. And Harold Quaritch! Well, there must be an end to that.
      It was hard, too&mdash;only a woman could know how hard. Ida was not a
      person with a long record of love affairs. Once, when she was twenty, she
      had received a proposal which she had refused, and that was all. So it
      happened that when she became attached to Colonel Quaritch she had found
      her heart for the first time, and for a woman, somewhat late in life.
      Consequently her feelings were all the more profound, and so indeed was
      her grief at being forced not only to put them away, but to give herself
      to another man who was not agreeable to her. She was not a violent or
      ill-regulated woman like Mrs. Quest. She looked facts in the face,
      recognised their meaning and bowed before their inexorable logic. It
      seemed to her almost impossible that she could hope to avoid this
      marriage, and if that proved to be so, she might be relied upon to make
      the best of it. Scandal would, under any circumstances, never find a word
      to say against Ida, for she was not a person who could attempt to console
      herself for an unhappy marriage. But it was bitter, bitter as gall, to be
      thus forced to turn aside from her happiness&mdash;for she well knew that
      with Harold Quaritch her life would be very happy&mdash;and fit her
      shoulders to this heavy yoke. Well, she had saved the place to her father,
      and also to her descendants, if she had any, and that was all that could
      be said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought and thought, wishing in the bitterness of her heart that she
      had never been born to come to such a heavy day, till at last she could
      think no more. The air of the room seemed to stifle her, though it was by
      no means overheated. She went to the window and looked out. It was a wild
      wet evening, and the wind drove the rain before it in sheets. In the west
      the lurid rays of the sinking sun stained the clouds blood red, and broke
      in arrows of ominous light upon the driving storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      But bad as was the weather, it attracted Ida. When the heart is heavy and
      torn by conflicting passions, it seems to answer to the calling of the
      storm, and to long to lose its petty troubling in the turmoil of the
      rushing world. Nature has many moods of which our own are but the echo and
      reflection, and she can be companionable when all human sympathy must
      fail. For she is our mother from whom we come, to whom we go, and her arms
      are ever open to clasp the children who can hear her voices. Drawn thereto
      by an impulse which she could not have analysed, Ida went upstairs, put on
      a thick pair of boots, a macintosh and an old hat. Then she sallied out
      into the wind and wet. It was blowing big guns, and as the rain whirled
      down the drops struck upon her face like spray. She crossed the moat
      bridge, and went out into the parkland beyond. The air was full of dead
      leaves, and the grass rustled with them as though it were alive, for this
      was the first wind since the frost. The great boughs of the oaks rattled
      and groaned above her, and high overhead, among the sullen clouds, a
      flight of rooks were being blown this way and that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida bent her tall form against the rain and gale, and fought her way
      through them. At first she had no clear idea as to where she was going,
      but presently, perhaps from custom, she took the path that ran across the
      fields to Honham Church. It was a beautiful old church, particularly as
      regards the tower, one of the finest in the county, which had been
      partially blown down and rebuilt about the time of Charles I. The church
      itself had originally been founded by the Boissey family, and considerably
      enlarged by the widow of a de la Molle, whose husband had fallen at
      Agincourt, &ldquo;as a memorial for ever.&rdquo; There, upon the porch,
      were carved the &ldquo;hawks&rdquo; of the de la Molles, wreathed round
      with palms of victory; and there, too, within the chancel, hung the
      warrior&rsquo;s helmet and his dinted shield.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was he alone, for all around lay the dust of his kindred, come after
      the toil and struggle of their stormy lives to rest within the walls of
      that old church. Some of them had monuments of alabaster, whereon they lay
      in effigy, their heads pillowed upon that of a conquered Saracen; some had
      monuments of oak and brass, and some had no monuments at all, for the
      Puritans had ruthlessly destroyed them. But they were nearly all there,
      nearly twenty generations of the bearers of an ancient name, for even
      those of them who perished on the scaffold had been borne here for burial.
      The place was eloquent of the dead and of the mournful lesson of
      mortality. From century to century the bearers of that name had walked in
      these fields, and lived in yonder Castle, and looked upon the familiar
      swell of yonder ground and the silver flash of yonder river, and now their
      ashes were gathered here and all the forgotten turmoil of their lives was
      lost in the silence of those narrow tombs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida loved the spot, hallowed to her not only by the altar of her faith,
      but also by the human associations that clung around and clothed it as the
      ivy clothed its walls. Here she had been christened, and here among her
      ancestors she hoped to be buried also. Here as a girl, when the full moon
      was up, she had crept in awed silence with her brother James to look
      through the window at the white and solemn figures stretched within. Here,
      too, she had sat on Sunday after Sunday for more than twenty years, and
      stared at the quaint Latin inscriptions cut on marble slabs, recording the
      almost superhuman virtues of departed de la Molles of the eighteenth
      century, her own immediate ancestors. The place was familiar to her whole
      life; she had scarcely a recollection with which it was not in some way
      connected. It was not wonderful, therefore, that she loved it, and that in
      the trouble of her mind her feet shaped their course towards it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she was in the churchyard. Taking her stand under the shelter of
      a line of Scotch firs, through which the gale sobbed and sang, she leant
      against a side gate and looked. The scene was desolate enough. Rain
      dropped from the roof on to the sodden graves beneath, and ran in thin
      sheets down the flint facing of the tower; the dead leaves whirled and
      rattled about the empty porch, and over all shot one red and angry arrow
      from the sinking sun. She stood in the storm and rain, gazing at the old
      church that had seen the end of so many sorrows more bitter than her own,
      and the wreck of so many summers, till the darkness began to close round
      her like a pall, while the wind sung the requiem of her hopes. Ida was not
      of a desponding or pessimistic character, but in that bitter hour she
      found it in her heart, as most people have at one time or another in their
      lives, to wish the tragedy over and the curtain down, and that she lay
      beneath those dripping sods without sight or hearing, without hope or
      dread. It seemed to her that the Hereafter must indeed be terrible if it
      outweighs the sorrows of the Here.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, poor woman, she thought of the long years between her and rest,
      and leaning her head against the gate-post, began to cry bitterly in the
      gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she ceased crying and with a start looked up, feeling that she
      was no longer alone. Her instincts had not deceived her, for in the shadow
      of the fir trees, not more than two paces from her, was the figure of a
      man. Just then he took a step to the left, which brought his outline
      against the sky, and Ida&rsquo;s heart stood still, for now she knew him.
      It was Harold Quaritch, the man over whose loss she had been weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very odd,&rdquo; she heard him say, for she was to
      leeward of him, &ldquo;but I could have sworn that I heard somebody
      sobbing; I suppose it was the wind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida&rsquo;s first idea was flight, and she made a movement for that
      purpose, but in doing so tripped over a stick and nearly fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a minute he was by her side. She was caught, and perhaps she was not
      altogether sorry, especially as she had tried to get away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it? what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; said the Colonel,
      lighting a fusee under her eyes. It was one of those flaming fusees, and
      burnt with a blue light, showing Ida&rsquo;s tall figure and beautiful
      face, all stained with grief and tears, showing her wet macintosh, and the
      gate-post against which she had been leaning&mdash;showing everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Ida,&rdquo; he said in amaze, &ldquo;what are you doing here,
      crying too?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not crying,&rdquo; she said, with a sob; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
      the rain that has made my face wet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then the light burnt out and he dropped it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, dear, what is it?&rdquo; he said in great distress, for
      the sight of her alone in the wet and dark, and in tears, moved him beyond
      himself. Indeed he would have been no man if it had not.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried to answer, but she could not, and in another minute, to tell the
      honest truth, she had exchanged the gate-post for Harold&rsquo;s broad
      shoulder, and was finishing her &ldquo;cry&rdquo; there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now to see a young and pretty woman weeping (more especially if she
      happens to be weeping on your shoulder) is a very trying thing. It is
      trying even if you do not happen to be in love with her at all. But if you
      are in love with her, however little, it is dreadful; whereas, if, as in
      the present case, you happen to worship her, more, perhaps, than it is
      good to worship any fallible human creature, then the sight is positively
      overpowering. And so, indeed, it proved in the present instance. The
      Colonel could not bear it, but lifting her head from his shoulder, he
      kissed her sweet face again and again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, darling?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what is the matter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave go of me and I will tell you,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He obeyed, though with some unwillingness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hunted for her handkerchief and wiped her eyes, and then at last she
      spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am engaged to be married,&rdquo; she said in a low voice, &ldquo;I
      am engaged to Mr. Cossey.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, for about the first time in his life, Harold Quaritch swore
      violently in the presence of a lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, damn it all!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took no notice of the strength of the language, perhaps indeed she
      re-echoed it in some feminine equivalent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; she said with a sigh. &ldquo;I knew that it
      would come, those dreadful things always do&mdash;and it was not my fault&mdash;I
      am sure you will always remember that. I had to do it&mdash;he advanced
      the money on the express condition, and even if I could pay back the
      money, I suppose that I should be bound to carry out the bargain. It is
      not the money which he wants but his bond.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curse him for a Shylock,&rdquo; said Harold again, and groaned in
      his bitterness and jealousy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there nothing to be done?&rdquo; he asked presently in a harsh
      voice, for he was very hard hit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she answered sadly. &ldquo;I do not see what can
      help us, unless the man died,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and that is not
      likely. Harold,&rdquo; she went on, addressing him for the first time in
      her life by his Christian name, for she felt that after crying upon a man&rsquo;s
      shoulder it is ridiculous to scruple about calling him by his name;
      &ldquo;Harold, there is no help for it. I did it myself, remember,
      because, as I told you, I do not think that any one woman has a right to
      place her individual happiness before the welfare of her family. And I am
      only sorry,&rdquo; she added, her voice breaking a little, &ldquo;that
      what I have done should bring suffering upon you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He groaned again, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must try to forget,&rdquo; she went on wildly. &ldquo;Oh no! no!
      I feel it is not possible that we should forget. You won&rsquo;t forget
      me, Harold, will you? And though it must be all over between us, and we
      must never speak like this again&mdash;never&mdash;you will always know I
      have not forgotten you, will you not, but that I think of you always?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no fear of my forgetting,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I am
      selfish enough to hope that you will think of me at times, Ida.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed I will. We all have our burdens to bear. It is a hard
      world, and we must bear them. And it will all be the same in the end, in
      just a few years. I daresay these dead people here have felt as we feel,
      and how quiet they are! And perhaps there may be something beyond, where
      things are not so. Who can say? You won&rsquo;t go away from this place,
      Harold, will you? Not until I am married at any rate; perhaps you had
      better go then. Say that you won&rsquo;t go till then, and you will let me
      see you sometimes; it is a comfort to see you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have gone, certainly,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;to New
      Zealand probably, but if you wish it I will stop for the present.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you; and now good-bye, my dear, good-bye! No, don&rsquo;t
      come with me, I can find my own way home. And&mdash;why do you wait?
      Good-bye, good-bye for ever in this way. Yes, kiss me once and swear that
      you will never forget me. Marry if you wish to; but don&rsquo;t forget me,
      Harold. Forgive me for speaking so plainly, but I speak as one about to
      die to you, and I wish things to be clear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never marry and I shall never forget you,&rdquo; he
      answered. &ldquo;Good-bye, my love, good-bye!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In another minute she had vanished into the storm and rain, out of his
      sight and out of his life, but not out of his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, too, turned and went his way into the wild and lonely night.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour afterwards Ida came down into the drawing-room dressed for dinner,
      looking rather pale but otherwise quite herself. Presently the Squire
      arrived. He had been at a magistrate&rsquo;s meeting, and had only just
      got home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Ida,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I could not find you anywhere. I
      met George as I was driving from Boisingham, and he told me that he saw
      you walking through the park.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he?&rdquo; she answered indifferently. &ldquo;Yes, I have been
      out. It was so stuffy indoors. Father,&rdquo; she went on, with a change
      of tone, &ldquo;I have something to tell you. I am engaged to be married.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her curiously, and then said quietly&mdash;the Squire was
      always quiet in any matter of real emergency&mdash;&ldquo;Indeed, my dear!
      That is a serious matter. However, speaking off-hand, I think that
      notwithstanding the disparity of age, Quaritch&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she said, wincing visibly, &ldquo;I am not engaged
      to Colonel Quaritch, I am engaged to Mr. Cossey.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;oh, indeed! I thought from what I saw,
      that&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the servant announced dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, never mind about it now, father,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I am
      tired and want my dinner. Mr. Cossey is coming to see you to-morrow, and
      we can talk about it afterwards.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And though the Squire thought a good deal, he made no further allusion to
      the subject that night.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV. &mdash; THE SQUIRE GIVES HIS CONSENT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Edward Cossey did not come away from the scene of his engagement in a very
      happy or triumphant tone of mind. Ida&rsquo;s bitter words stung like
      whips, and he understood, and she clearly meant he should understand, that
      it was only in consideration of the money advanced that she had consented
      to become his wife. Now, however satisfactory it is to be rich enough to
      purchase your heart&rsquo;s desire in this fashion, it is not altogether
      soothing to the pride of a nineteenth-century man to be continually
      haunted by the thought that he is a buyer in the market and nothing but a
      buyer. Of course, he saw clearly enough that there was an object in all
      this&mdash;he saw that Ida, by making obvious her dislike, wished to
      disgust him with his bargain, and escape from an alliance of which the
      prospect was hateful to her. But he had no intention of being so easily
      discouraged. In the first place his passion for the woman was as a
      devouring flame, eating ever at his heart. In that at any rate he was
      sincere; he did love her so far as his nature was capable of love, or at
      any rate he had the keenest desire to make her his wife. A delicate-minded
      man would probably have shrunken from forcing himself upon a woman under
      parallel circumstances; but Edward Cossey did not happen to fall into that
      category. As a matter of fact such men are not as common as they might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another thing which he took into account was that Ida would probably get
      over her dislike. He was a close observer of women, in a cynical and half
      contemptuous way, and he remarked, or thought that he remarked, a curious
      tendency among them to submit with comparative complacency to the
      inevitable whenever it happened to coincide with their material advantage.
      Women, he argued, have not, as a class, outgrown the traditions of their
      primitive condition when their partners for life were chosen for them by
      lot or the chance of battle. They still recognise the claims of the
      wealthiest or strongest, and their love of luxury and ease is so keen that
      if the nest they lie in is only soft enough, they will not grieve long
      over the fact that it was not of their own choosing. Arguing from these
      untrustworthy premises, he came to the conclusion that Ida would soon get
      over her repugnance to marrying him, when she found how many comforts and
      good things marriage with so rich a man would place at her disposal, and
      would, if for no other reason, learn to look on him with affection and
      gratitude as the author of her gilded ease. And so indeed she might have
      done had she been of another and more common stamp. But, unfortunately for
      his reasoning, there exist members of her sex who are by nature of an
      order of mind superior to these considerations, and who realise that they
      have but one life to live, and that the highest form of happiness is <i>not</i>
      dependent upon money or money&rsquo;s worth, but rather upon the
      indulgence of mental aspirations and those affections which, when genuine,
      draw nearer to holiness than anything else about us. Such a woman, more
      especially if she is already possessed with an affection for another man,
      does not easily become reconciled to a distasteful lot, however quietly
      she may endure it, and such a woman was Ida de la Molle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward Cossey, when he reached Boisingham on the evening of his
      engagement, at once wrote and posted a note to the Squire, saying that he
      would call on the following morning about a matter of business.
      Accordingly, at half-past ten o&rsquo;clock, he arrived and was shown into
      the vestibule, where he found the old gentleman standing with his back to
      the fire and plunged in reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. de la Molle,&rdquo; said Edward, rather nervously, so
      soon as he had shaken hands, &ldquo;I do not know if Ida has spoken to you
      about what took place between us yesterday.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;yes, she told me something to the
      effect that she had accepted a proposal of marriage from you, subject to
      my consent, of course; but really the whole thing is so sudden that I have
      hardly had time to consider it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very simple,&rdquo; said Edward; &ldquo;I am deeply attached
      to your daughter, and I have been so fortunate as to be accepted by her.
      Should you give your consent to the marriage, I may as well say at once
      that I wish to carry out the most liberal money arrangements in my power.
      I will make Ida a present of the mortgage that I hold over this property,
      and she may put it in the fire. Further, I will covenant on the death of
      my father, which cannot now be long delayed, to settle two hundred
      thousand pounds upon her absolutely. Also, I am prepared to agree that if
      we have a son, and he should wish to do so, he shall take the name of de
      la Molle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; said the Squire, turning round to hide his
      natural gratification at these proposals, &ldquo;your offers on the
      subject of settlements are of a most liberal order, and of course so far
      as I am concerned, Ida will have this place, which may one day be again
      more valuable than it is now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad that they meet with your approval,&rdquo; said Edward;
      &ldquo;and now there is one more thing I want to ask you, Mr. de la Molle,
      and which I hope, if you give your consent to the marriage, you will not
      raise any objection to. It is, that our engagement should not be announced
      at present. The fact is,&rdquo; he went on hurriedly, &ldquo;my father is
      a very peculiar man, and has a great idea of my marrying somebody with a
      large fortune. Also his state of health is so uncertain that there is no
      possibility of knowing how he will take anything. Indeed he is dying; the
      doctors told me that he might go off any day, and that he cannot last for
      another three months. If the engagement is announced to him now, at the
      best I shall have a great deal of trouble, and at the worst he might make
      me suffer in his will, should he happen to take a fancy against it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Umph,&rdquo; said the Squire, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite like the
      idea of a projected marriage with my daughter, Miss de la Molle of Honham
      Castle, being hushed up as though there were something discreditable about
      it, but still there may be peculiar circumstances in the case which would
      justify me in consenting to that course. You are both old enough to know
      your own minds, and the match would be as advantageous for you as it could
      be to us, for even now-a-days, family, and I may even say personal
      appearance, still go for something where matrimony is concerned. I have
      reason to know that your father is a peculiar man, very peculiar. Yes, on
      the whole, though I don&rsquo;t like hole and corner affairs, I shall have
      no objection to the engagement not being announced for the next month or
      two.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for considering me so much,&rdquo; said Edward with a
      sigh of relief. &ldquo;Then am I to understand that you give your consent
      to our engagement?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire reflected for a moment. Everything seemed quite straight, and
      yet he suspected crookedness. His latent distrust of the man, which had
      not been decreased by the scene of two nights before&mdash;for he never
      could bring himself to like Edward Cossey&mdash;arose in force and made
      him hesitate when there was no visible ground for hesitation. He
      possessed, as has been said, an instinctive insight into character that
      was almost feminine in its intensity, and it was lifting a warning finger
      before him now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite know what to say,&rdquo; he replied at length.
      &ldquo;The whole affair is so sudden&mdash;and to tell you the truth, I
      thought that Ida had bestowed her affections in another direction.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward&rsquo;s face darkened. &ldquo;I thought so too,&rdquo; he answered,
      &ldquo;until yesterday, when I was so happy as to be undeceived. I ought
      to tell you, by the way,&rdquo; he went on, running away from the covert
      falsehood in his last words as quickly as he could, &ldquo;how much I
      regret I was the cause of that scene with Colonel Quaritch, more
      especially as I find that there is an explanation of the story against
      him. The fact is, I was foolish enough to be vexed because he beat me out
      shooting, and also because, well I&mdash;I was jealous of him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; said the Squire, rather coldly, &ldquo;a most
      unfortunate affair. Of course, I don&rsquo;t know what the particulars of
      the matter were, and it is no business of mine, but speaking generally, I
      should say never bring an accusation of that sort against a man at all
      unless you are driven to it, and if you do bring it be quite certain of
      your ground. However, that is neither here nor there. Well, about this
      engagement. Ida is old enough to judge for herself, and seems to have made
      up her mind, so as I know no reason to the contrary, and as the business
      arrangements proposed are all that I could wish, I cannot see that I have
      any ground for withholding my consent. So all I can say, sir, is that I
      hope you will make my daughter a good husband, and that you will both be
      happy. Ida is a high-spirited woman; but in my opinion she is greatly
      above the average of her sex, as I have known it, and provided you have
      her affection, and don&rsquo;t attempt to drive her, she will go through
      thick and thin for you. But I dare say you would like to see her. Oh, by
      the way, I forgot, she has got a headache this morning, and is stopping in
      bed. It isn&rsquo;t much in her line, but I daresay that she is a little
      upset. Perhaps you would like to come up to dinner to-night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This proposition Edward, knowing full well that Ida&rsquo;s headache was a
      device to rid herself of the necessity of seeing him, accepted with
      gratitude and went.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he had gone, Ida herself came down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; said the Squire cheerfully, &ldquo;I have
      just had the pleasure of seeing Edward Cossey, and I have told him that,
      as you seemed to wish it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Ida made a movement of impatience, but remembered herself and said
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That as you seemed to wish that things should be so, I had no
      ground of objection to your engagement. I may as well tell you that the
      proposals which he makes as regards settlements are of the most liberal
      nature.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they?&rdquo; answered Ida indifferently. &ldquo;Is Mr. Cossey
      coming here to dinner?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I asked him. I thought that you would like to see him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I wish you had not,&rdquo; she answered with animation,
      &ldquo;because there is nothing to eat except some cold beef. Really,
      father, it is very thoughtless of you;&rdquo; and she stamped her foot and
      went off in a huff, leaving the Squire full of reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what it all means,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;She
      can&rsquo;t care about the man much or she would not make that fuss about
      his being asked to dinner. Ida isn&rsquo;t the sort of woman to be caught
      by the money, I should think. Well, I know nothing about it; it is no
      affair of mine, and I can only take things as I find them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he fell to reflecting that this marriage would be an
      extraordinary stroke of luck for the family. Here they were at the last
      gasp, mortgaged up the eyes, when suddenly fortune, in the shape of an, on
      the whole, perfectly unobjectionable young man, appears, takes up the
      mortgages, proposes settlements to the tune of hundreds of thousands, and
      even offers to perpetuate the old family name in the person of his son,
      should he have one. Such a state of affairs could not but be gratifying to
      any man, however unworldly, and the Squire was not altogether unworldly.
      That is, he had a keen sense of the dignity of his social position and his
      family, and it had all his life been his chief and laudable desire to be
      sufficiently provided with the goods of this world to raise the de la
      Molles to the position which they had occupied in former centuries.
      Hitherto, however, the tendency of events had been all the other way&mdash;the
      house was a sinking one, and but the other day its ancient roof had nearly
      fallen about their ears. But now the prospect changed as though by magic.
      On Ida&rsquo;s marriage all the mortgages, those heavy accumulations of
      years of growing expenditure and narrowing means, would roll off the back
      of the estate, and the de la Molles of Honham Castle would once more take
      the place in the county to which they were undoubtedly entitled.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not wonderful that the prospect proved a pleasing one to him, or
      that his head was filled with visions of splendours to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it chanced, on that very morning it was necessary for Mr. Quest to pay
      the old gentleman a visit in order to obtain his signature to a lease of a
      bakery in Boisingham, which, together with two or three other houses,
      belonged to the estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      He arrived just as the Squire was in the full flow of his meditations, and
      it would not have needed a man of Mr. Quest&rsquo;s penetration and powers
      of observation to discover that he had something on his mind which he was
      longing for an opportunity to talk about.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire signed the lease without paying the slightest attention to Mr.
      Quest&rsquo;s explanations, and then suddenly asked him when the first
      interest on the recently-effected mortgages came due.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer mentioned a certain date.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the Squire, &ldquo;then it will have to be met; but
      it does not matter, it will be for the last time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Quest pricked up his ears and looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, Quest,&rdquo; he went on by way of explanation,
      &ldquo;that there are&mdash;well&mdash;family arrangements pending which
      will put an end to these embarrassments in a natural and a proper way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Mr. Quest, &ldquo;I am very glad to hear it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said the Squire, &ldquo;unfortunately I am under
      some restraints in speaking about the matter at present, or I should like
      to ask your opinion, for which as you know I have a great respect. Really,
      though, I do not know why I should not consult my lawyer on a matter of
      business; I only consented not to trumpet the thing about.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lawyers are confidential agents,&rdquo; said Mr. Quest quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course they are. Of course, and it is their business to hold
      their tongues. I may rely upon your discretion, may I not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Mr. Quest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the matter is this: Mr. Edward Cossey is engaged to Miss de
      la Molle. He has just been here to obtain my consent, which, of course, I
      have not withheld, as I know nothing against the young man&mdash;nothing
      at all. The only stipulation that he made is, as I think, a reasonable one
      under the circumstances, namely, that the engagement is to be kept quiet
      for a little while on account of the condition of his father&rsquo;s
      health. He says that he is an unreasonable man, and that he might take a
      prejudice against it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      During this announcement Mr. Quest had remained perfectly quiet, his face
      showing no signs of excitement, only his eyes shone with a curious light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is very interesting news.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Squire. &ldquo;That is what I meant by saying
      that there would be no necessity to make any arrangements as to the future
      payment of interest, for Cossey has informed me that he proposes to put
      the mortgage bonds in the fire before his marriage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Mr. Quest; &ldquo;well, he could hardly do
      less, could he? Altogether, I think you ought to be congratulated, Mr. de
      la Molle. It is not often that a man gets such a chance of clearing the
      encumbrances off a property. And now I am very sorry, but I must be
      getting home, as I promised my wife to be back for luncheon. As the thing
      is to be kept quiet, I suppose that it would be premature for me to offer
      my good wishes to Miss de la Molle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, don&rsquo;t say anything about it at present. Well,
      good-bye.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI. &mdash; BELLE PAYS A VISIT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Quest got into his dog-cart and drove homewards, full of feelings
      which it would be difficult to describe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour of his revenge was come. He had played his cards and he had won
      the game, and fortune with it, for his enemy lay in the hollow of his
      hand. He looked behind him at the proud towers of the Castle, reflecting
      as he did so, that in all probability they would belong to him before
      another year was over his head. At one time he had earnestly longed to
      possess this place, but now this was not so much the object of his desire.
      What he wanted now was the money. With thirty thousand pounds in his hand
      he would, together with what he had, be a rich man, and he had already
      laid his plans for the future. Of Edith he had heard nothing lately. She
      was cowed, but he well knew that it was only for a while. By-and-by her
      rapacity would get the better of her fear and she would recommence her
      persecutions. This being so, he came to a determination&mdash;he would put
      the world between them. Once let him have this money in his hand and he
      would start his life afresh in some new country; he was not too old for
      it, and he would be a rich man, and then perhaps he might get rid of the
      cares which had rendered so much of his existence valueless. If Belle
      would go with him, well and good&mdash;if not, he could not help it. If
      she did go, there must be a reconciliation first, for he could not any
      longer tolerate the life they lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      In due course he reached the Oaks and went in. Luncheon was on the table,
      at which Belle was sitting. She was, as usual, dressed in black, and
      beautiful to look on; but her round babyish face was pale and pinched, and
      there were black lines beneath her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know that you were coming back to luncheon,&rdquo; she
      said; &ldquo;I am afraid there is not much to eat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I finished my business up at the
      Castle, so I thought I might as well come home. By-the-by, Belle, I have a
      bit of news for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked, looking up sharply, for something in
      his tone attracted her attention and awoke her fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friend, Edward Cossey, is going to be married to Ida de la
      Molle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She blanched till she looked like death itself, and put her hands to her
      heart as though she had been stabbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Squire told me so himself,&rdquo; he went on, keeping his eyes
      remorselessly fixed upon her face. She leaned forward and he thought that
      she was going to faint, but she did not. By a supreme effort she recovered
      herself and drank a glass of sherry which was standing by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expected it,&rdquo; she said in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that you dreaded it,&rdquo; answered Mr. Quest quietly. He
      rose and locked the door and then came and stood close to her and spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Belle. I know all about your affair with Edward Cossey. I
      have proofs of it, but I have forborne to use them, because I saw that in
      the end he would weary of you and desert you for some other woman, and
      that would be my best revenge upon you. You have all along been nothing
      but his toy, the light woman with whom he amused his leisure hours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her hands back over her heart but said no word and he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Belle, I did wrong to marry you when you did not want to marry me,
      but, being married, you have done wrong to be unfaithful to your vows. I
      have been rewarded by your infidelity, and your infidelity has been
      rewarded by desertion. Now I have a proposal to make, and if you are wise
      you will accept it. Let us set the one wrong against the other; let both
      be forgotten. Forgive me, and I will forgive you, and let us make peace&mdash;if
      not now, then in a little while, when your heart is not so sore&mdash;and
      go right away from Edward Cossey and Ida de la Molle and Honham and
      Boisingham, into some new part of the world where we can begin life again
      and try to forget the past.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him and shook her head mournfully, and twice she tried to
      speak and twice she failed. The third time her words came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not understand me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You are very kind
      and I am very grateful to you, but you do not understand me. I cannot get
      over things so easily as I know most women can; what I have done I never
      can undo. I do not blame him altogether, it was as much or more my fault
      than his, but having once loved him I cannot go back to you or any other
      man. If you like I will go on living with you as we live, and I will try
      to make you comfortable, but I can say no more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think again, Belle,&rdquo; he said almost pleadingly; &ldquo;I
      daresay that you have never given me credit for much tenderness of heart,
      and I know that you have as much against me as I have against you. But I
      have always loved you, and I love you now, really and truly love you, and
      I will make you a good husband if you will let me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very good,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but it cannot be. Get
      rid of me if you like and marry somebody else. I am ready to take the
      penalty of what I have done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once more, Belle, I beg you to consider. Do you know what kind of
      man this is for whom you are giving up your life? Not only has he deserted
      you, but do you know how he has got hold of Ida de la Molle? He has, as I
      know well, <i>bought</i> her. I tell you he has bought her as much as
      though he had gone into the open market and paid down a price for her. The
      other day Cossey and Son were going to foreclose upon the Honham estates,
      which would have ruined the old gentleman. Well, what did your young man
      do? He went to the girl&mdash;who hates him, by the way, and is in love
      with Colonel Quaritch&mdash;and said to her, &lsquo;If you will promise to
      marry me when I ask you, I will find the thirty thousand pounds and take
      up the mortgages.&rsquo; And on those terms she agreed to marry him. And
      now he has got rid of you and he claims her promise. There is the history.
      I wonder that your pride will bear such a thing. By heaven, I would kill
      the man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him curiously. &ldquo;Would you?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It
      is not a bad idea. I dare say it is all true. He is worthless. Why does
      one fall in love with worthless people? Well, there is an end of it; or a
      beginning of the end. As I have sown, so must I reap;&rdquo; and she got
      up, and unlocking the door left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said aloud when she had gone, &ldquo;there is a
      beginning of the end. Upon my word, what between one thing and another,
      unlucky devil as I am, I had rather stand in my own shoes than in Edward
      Cossey&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Belle went to her room and sat thinking, or rather brooding, sullenly.
      Then she put on her bonnet and cloak and started out, taking the road that
      ran past Honham Castle. She had not gone a hundred yards before she found
      herself face to face with Edward Cossey himself. He was coming out of a
      gunsmith&rsquo;s shop, where he had been ordering some cartridges.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Belle?&rdquo; he said, colouring and lifting his
      hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Cossey?&rdquo; she answered, coming to a stop
      and looking him straight in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; he asked, not knowing what to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to walk up to the Castle to call on Miss de la Molle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that you will find her. She is in bed with a
      headache.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! So you have been up there this morning?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I had to see the Squire about some business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo; Then looking him in the eyes again, &ldquo;Are you
      engaged to be married to Ida?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He coloured once more, he could not prevent himself from doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;what makes you ask such a question?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said, laughing a little; &ldquo;feminine
      curiosity I suppose. I thought that you might be. Good-bye,&rdquo; and she
      went on, leaving Edward Cossey to the enjoyment of a very peculiar set of
      sensations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a coward!&rdquo; said Belle to herself. &ldquo;He does not
      even dare to tell me the truth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly an hour later she arrived at the Castle, and, asking for Ida, was
      shown into the drawing-room, where she found her sitting with a book in
      her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida rose to greet her in friendly fashion, for the two women, although
      they were at the opposite poles of character, had a liking for each other.
      In a way they were both strong, and strength always recognises and
      respects strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you walked up?&rdquo; asked Ida.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I came on the chance of finding you. I want to speak to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ida, &ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This. Forgive me, but are you engaged to be married to Edward
      Cossey?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida looked at her in a slow, stately way, which seemed to ask by what
      right she came to question her. At least, so Belle read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that I have no right to ask such a question,&rdquo; she
      said, with humility, &ldquo;and, of course, you need not answer it, but I
      have a reason for asking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Ida, &ldquo;I was requested by Mr. Cossey to keep
      the matter secret, but he appears to have divulged it. Yes, I am engaged
      to be married to him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Belle&rsquo;s beautiful face turned a shade paler, if that was possible,
      and her eyes hardened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wonder why I ask you this?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I will
      tell you, though probably when I have done so you will never speak to me
      again. I am Edward Cossey&rsquo;s discarded mistress,&rdquo; and she
      laughed bitterly enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida shrank a little and coloured, as a pure and high-minded woman
      naturally does when she is for the first time suddenly brought into actual
      contact with impurity and passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; went on Belle, &ldquo;that I must seem a shameful
      thing to you; but, Miss de la Molle, good and cold and stately as you are,
      pray God that you may never be thrown into temptation; pray God that you
      may never be married almost by force to a man whom you hate, and then
      suddenly learn what a thing it is to fall in love, and for the first time
      feel your life awake.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; said Ida gently, &ldquo;what right have I to judge
      you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I loved him,&rdquo; went on Belle, &ldquo;I loved him passionately,
      and for a while it was as though heaven had opened its gates, for he used
      to care for me a little, and I think he would have taken me away and
      married me afterwards, but I would not hear of it, because I knew that it
      would ruin him. He offered to, once, and I refused, and within three hours
      of that I believe he was bargaining for you. Well, and then it was the old
      story, he fell more and more in love with you and of course I had no hold
      upon him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ida, moving impatiently, &ldquo;but why do you
      tell me all this? It is very painful and I had rather not hear it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do I tell you? I tell you because I do not wish you to marry
      Edward Cossey. I tell you because I wish <i>him</i> to feel a little of
      what <i>I</i> have to feel, and because I have said that he should <i>not</i>
      marry you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish that you could prevent it,&rdquo; said Ida, with a sudden
      outburst. &ldquo;I am sure you are quite welcome to Mr. Cossey so far as I
      am concerned, for I detest him, and I cannot imagine how any woman could
      ever have done otherwise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;but I have done with Mr.
      Cossey, and I think I hate him too. I know that I did hate him when I met
      him in the street just now and he told me that he was not engaged to you.
      You say that you detest him, why then do you marry him&mdash;you are a
      free woman?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to know?&rdquo; said Ida, wheeling round and looking
      her visitor full in the face. &ldquo;I am going to marry him for the same
      reason that you say caused you to marry&mdash;because I <i>must</i>. I am
      going to marry him because he lent us money on condition that I promised
      to marry him, and as I have taken the money, I must give him his price,
      even if it breaks my heart. You think that you are wretched; how do you
      know that I am not fifty times as wretched? Your lot is to lose your
      lover, mine is to have one forced upon me and endure him all my life. The
      worst of your pain is over, all mine is to come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? why?&rdquo; broke in Belle. &ldquo;What is such a promise as
      that? He cannot force you to marry him, and it is better for a woman to
      die than to marry a man she hates, especially,&rdquo; she added meaningly,
      &ldquo;if she happens to care for somebody else. Be advised by me, I know
      what it is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ida, &ldquo;perhaps it is better to die, but death
      is not so easy. As for the promise, you do not seem to understand that no
      gentleman or lady can break a promise in consideration of which money has
      been received. Whatever he has done, and whatever he is, I <i>must</i>
      marry Mr. Cossey, so I do not think that we need discuss the subject any
      more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Belle sat silent for a minute or more, and then rising said that she must
      go. &ldquo;I have warned you,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;although to warn
      you I am forced to put myself at your mercy. You can tell the story and
      destroy me if you like. I do not much care if you do. Women such as I grow
      reckless.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must understand me very little, Mrs. Quest&rdquo; (it had
      always been Belle before, and she winced at the changed name), &ldquo;if
      you think me capable of such conduct. You have nothing to fear from me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She held out her hand, but in her humility and shame, Belle went without
      taking it, and through the angry sunset light walked slowly back to
      Boisingham. And as she walked there was a look upon her face that Edward
      Cossey would scarcely have cared to see.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII. &mdash; MR. QUEST HAS HIS INNINGS
    </h2>
    <p>
      All that afternoon and far into the evening Mr. Quest was employed in
      drafting, and with his own hand engrossing on parchment certain deeds, for
      the proper execution of which he seemed to find constant reference
      necessary to a tin box of papers labelled &ldquo;Honham Castle Estates.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      By eleven that night everything was finished, and having carefully
      collected and docketed his papers, he put the tin box away and went home
      to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning, about ten o&rsquo;clock, Edward Cossey was sitting at
      breakfast in no happy frame of mind. He had gone up to the Castle to
      dinner on the previous evening, but it cannot be said that he had enjoyed
      himself. Ida was there, looking very handsome in her evening dress, but
      she was cold as a stone and unapproachable as a statue. She scarcely spoke
      to him, indeed, except in answer to some direct remark, reserving all her
      conversation for her father, who seemed to have caught the contagion of
      restraint, and was, for him, unusually silent and depressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But once or twice he found her looking at him, and then there was upon her
      face a mingled expression of contempt and irresistible aversion which
      chilled him to the marrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      These qualities were indeed so much more plainly developed towards himself
      than they had been before, that at last a conviction which he at first
      rejected as incredible forced itself into his mind. This conviction was,
      that Belle had disbelieved his denial of the engagement, and in her
      eagerness for revenge, must have told Ida the whole story. The thought
      made him feel faint. Well, there was but one thing to be done&mdash;face
      it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once when the Squire&rsquo;s back was turned he had ventured to attempt
      some little verbal tenderness in which the word &ldquo;dear&rdquo;
      occurred, but Ida did not seem to hear it and looked straight over his
      head into space. This he felt was trying. So trying did he find the whole
      entertainment indeed that about half-past nine he rose and came away,
      saying that he had received some bank papers which must be attended to
      that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now most men would in all human probability have been dismayed by this
      state of affairs into relinquishing an attempt at matrimony which it was
      evident could only be carried through in the face of the quiet but none
      the less vigorous dislike and contempt of the other contracting party. But
      this was not so with Edward Cossey. Ida&rsquo;s coldness excited upon his
      tenacious and obstinate mind much the same effect that may be supposed to
      be produced upon the benighted seeker for the North Pole by the sight of a
      frozen ocean of icebergs. Like the explorer he was convinced that if once
      he could get over those cold heights he would find a smiling sunny land
      beyond and perchance many other delights, and like the explorer again, he
      was, metaphorically, ready to die in the effort. For he loved her more
      every day, till now his passion dominated his physical being and his
      mental judgment, so that whatever loss was entailed, and whatever
      obstacles arose, he was determined to endure and overcome them if by so
      doing he might gain his end.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was reflecting upon all this on the morning in question when Mr. Quest,
      looking very cool, composed and gentlemanlike, was shown into his room,
      much as Colonel Quaritch had been shown in two mornings before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Quest?&rdquo; he said, in a from high to low tone,
      which he was in the habit of adopting towards his official subordinates.
      &ldquo;Sit down. What is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is some business, Mr. Cossey,&rdquo; the lawyer answered in his
      usual quiet tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honham Castle mortgages again, I suppose,&rdquo; he growled.
      &ldquo;I only hope you don&rsquo;t want any more money on that account at
      present, that&rsquo;s all; because I can&rsquo;t raise another cent while
      my father lives. They don&rsquo;t entail cash and bank shares, you know,
      and though my credit&rsquo;s pretty good I am not far from the bottom of
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Quest, with a faint smile, &ldquo;it has to
      do with the Honham Castle mortgages; but as I have a good deal to say,
      perhaps we had better wait till the things are cleared.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Just ring the bell, will you, and take a cigarette?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Quest smiled again and rang the bell, but did not take the cigarette.
      When the breakfast things had been removed he took a chair, and placing it
      on the further side of the table in such a position that the light, which
      was to his back, struck full upon Edward Cossey&rsquo;s face, began to
      deliberately untie and sort his bundle of papers. Presently he came to the
      one he wanted&mdash;a letter. It was not an original letter, but a copy.
      &ldquo;Will you kindly read this, Mr. Cossey?&rdquo; he said quietly, as
      he pushed the letter towards him across the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward finished lighting his cigarette, then took the letter up and
      glanced at it carelessly. At sight of the first line his expression
      changed to one of absolute horror, his face blanched, the perspiration
      sprang out upon his forehead, and the cigarette dropped from his fingers
      to the carpet, where it lay smouldering. Nor was this wonderful, for the
      letter was a copy of one of Belle&rsquo;s most passionate epistles to
      himself. He had never been able to restrain her from writing these
      compromising letters. Indeed, this one was the very same that some little
      time before Mr. Quest had abstracted from the pocket of Mr. Cossey&rsquo;s
      lounging coat in the room in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      He read on for a little way and then put the letter down upon the table.
      There was no need for him to go further, it was all in the same strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will observe, Mr. Cossey, that this is a copy,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Quest, &ldquo;but if you like you can inspect the original document.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; went on Mr. Quest, handing him a second paper, &ldquo;here
      is the copy of another letter, of which the original is in your
      handwriting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward looked at it. It was an intercepted letter of his own, dated about
      a year before, and its contents, though not of so passionate a nature as
      the other, were of a sufficiently incriminating character.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put it down upon the table by the side of the first and waited for Mr.
      Quest to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have other evidence,&rdquo; said his visitor presently, &ldquo;but
      you are probably sufficiently versed in such matters to know that these
      letters alone are almost enough for my purpose. That purpose is to
      commence a suit for divorce against my wife, in which you will, of course,
      in accordance with the provisions of the Act, be joined as co-respondent.
      Indeed, I have already drawn up a letter of instruction to my London
      agents directing them to take the preliminary steps,&rdquo; and he pushed
      a third paper towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward Cossey turned his back to his tormentor and resting his head upon
      his hand tried to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Quest,&rdquo; he said presently in a hoarse voice, &ldquo;without
      admitting anything, there are reasons which would make it ruinous to me if
      such an action were commenced at present.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;there are. In the first place there
      is no knowing in what light your father would look on the matter and how
      his view of it would affect your future interests. In the second your
      engagement to Miss de la Molle, upon which you are strongly set, would
      certainly be broken off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that I am engaged?&rdquo; asked Edward in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does not matter how I know it,&rdquo; said the lawyer, &ldquo;I
      do know it, so it will be useless for you to deny it. As you remark, this
      suit will probably be your ruin in every way, and therefore it is, as you
      will easily understand, a good moment for a man who wants his revenge to
      choose to bring it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without admitting anything,&rdquo; answered Edward Cossey, &ldquo;I
      wish to ask you a question. Is there no way out of this? Supposing that I
      have done you a wrong, wrong admits of compensation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it does, Mr. Cossey, and I have thought of that. Everybody has
      his price in this world and I have mine; but the compensation for such a
      wrong must be a heavy one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At what price will you agree to stay the action for ever?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The price that I will take to stay the action is the transfer into
      my name of the mortgages you hold over the Honham Castle Estates,&rdquo;
      answered Mr. Quest quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo; said Edward, &ldquo;why that is a matter of
      thirty thousand pounds.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it is, and I know also that it is worth your while to pay
      thirty thousand pounds to save yourself from the scandal, the chance of
      disinheritance, and the certainty of the loss of the woman whom you want
      to marry. So well do I know it that I have prepared the necessary deeds
      for your signature, and here they are. Listen, sir,&rdquo; he went on
      sternly; &ldquo;refuse to accept my terms and by to-night&rsquo;s post I
      shall send this letter of instructions. Also I shall send to Mr. Cossey,
      Senior, and to Mr. de la Molle copies of these two precious epistles,&rdquo;
      and he pointed to the incriminating documents, &ldquo;together with a copy
      of the letter to my agents; and where will you be then? Consent, and I
      will bind myself not to proceed in any way or form. Now, make your choice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I cannot; even if I will, I cannot,&rdquo; said he, almost
      wringing his hands in his perplexity. &ldquo;It was on condition of my
      taking up those mortgages that Ida consented to become engaged to me, and
      I have promised that I will cancel them on our wedding. Will you not take
      money instead?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Mr. Quest, &ldquo;I would take money. A little
      time ago I would not have taken it because I wanted that property; now I
      have changed my ideas. But as you yourself said, your credit is strained
      to the utmost, and while your father is alive you will not find it
      possible to raise another thirty thousand pounds. Besides, if this matter
      is to be settled at all it must be settled at once. I will not wait while
      you make attempts to raise the money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But about the mortgages? I promised to keep them. What shall I say
      to Ida?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say? Say nothing. You can meet them if you choose after your father&rsquo;s
      death. Refuse if you like, but if you refuse you will be mad. Thirty
      thousand pounds will be nothing to you, but exposure will be ruin. Have
      you made up your mind? You must take my offer or leave it. Sign the
      documents and I will put the originals of those two letters into your
      hands; refuse and I will take my steps.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward Cossey thought for a moment and then said, &ldquo;I will sign. Let
      me see the papers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Quest turned aside to hide the expression of triumph which flitted
      across his face and then handed him the deeds. They were elaborately
      drawn, for he was a skilful legal draughtsman, quite as skilful as many a
      leading Chancery conveyancer, but the substance of them was that the
      mortgages were transferred to him by the said Edward Cossey in and for the
      consideration that he, the said William M. Quest, consented to abandon for
      ever a pending action for divorce against his wife, Belle Quest, whereto
      the said Edward Cossey was to be joined as co-respondent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will observe,&rdquo; said Mr. Quest, &ldquo;that if you attempt
      to contest the validity of this assignment, which you probably could not
      do with any prospect of success, the attempt must recoil upon your own
      head, because the whole scandal will then transpire. We shall require some
      witnesses, so with your permission I will ring the bell and ask the
      landlady and your servant to step up. They need know nothing of the
      contents of the papers,&rdquo; and he did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said Edward presently. &ldquo;Where are the original
      letters?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; answered Mr. Quest, producing them from an inner
      pocket, and showing them to him at a distance. &ldquo;When the landlady
      comes up I will give them to her to hold in this envelope, directing her
      to hand them to you when the deeds are signed and witnessed. She will
      think that it is part of the ceremony.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the man-servant and the landlady arrived, and Mr. Quest, in his
      most matter-of-fact way, explained to them that they were required to
      witness some documents. At the same time he handed the letters to the
      woman, saying that she was to give them to Mr. Cossey when they had all
      done signing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Edward Cossey signed, and placing his thumb on the familiar wafer
      delivered the various documents as his act and deed. The witnesses with
      much preparation and effort affixed their awkward signatures in the places
      pointed out to them, and in a few minutes the thing was done, leaving Mr.
      Quest a richer man by thirty thousand pounds than when he had got up that
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now give Mr. Cossey the packet, Mrs. Jeffries,&rdquo; he said, as
      he blotted the signatures, &ldquo;and you can go.&rdquo; She did so and
      went.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the witnesses had gone Edward looked at the letters, and then with a
      savage oath flung them into the fire and watched them burn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Mr. Cossey,&rdquo; said Mr. Quest as he prepared to
      part with the deeds. &ldquo;You have now bought your experience and had to
      pay dearly for it; but, upon my word, when I think of all you owe me, I
      wonder at myself for letting you off at so small a price.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he had gone, Edward Cossey gave way to his feelings in language
      forcible rather than polite. For now, in addition to all the money which
      he had lost, and the painful exposure to which he had been subjected, he
      was face to face with a new difficulty. Either he must make a clean breast
      of it to Ida about the mortgages being no longer in his hands or he must
      pretend that he still had them. In the first alternative, the
      consideration upon which she had agreed to marry him came to nothing.
      Moreover, Ida was thereby released from her promise, and he was well aware
      that under these circumstances she would probably break off the
      engagement. In the second, he would be acting a lie, and the lie would
      sooner or later be discovered, and what then? Well, if it was after
      marriage, what would it matter? To a woman of gentle birth there is only
      one thing more irretrievable than marriage, and that is death. Anyhow, he
      had suffered so much for the sake of this woman that he did not mean to
      give her up now. He must meet the mortgages after marriage, that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Facilis est descensus Averni</i>. When a man of the character of Edward
      Cossey, or indeed of any character, allows his passions to lead him into a
      course of deceit, he does not find it easy to check his wild career. From
      dishonour to dishonour shall he go till at length, in due season, he reaps
      as he has sown.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII. &mdash; HOW GEORGE TREATED JOHNNIE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some two or three days before the scene described in the last chapter the
      faithful George had suddenly announced his desire to visit London.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; said the Squire in astonishment, for George had never
      been known to go out of his own county before. &ldquo;Why, what on earth
      are you going to do in London?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Squire,&rdquo; answered his retainer, looking marvellously
      knowing, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t rightly know, but there&rsquo;s a cheap
      train goes up to this here Exhibition on the Tuesday morning and comes
      back on the Thursday evening. Ten shillings both ways, that&rsquo;s the
      fare, and I see in the <i>Chronicle</i>, I du, that there&rsquo;s a
      wonnerful show of these new-fangled self-tying and delivering reapers,
      sich as they foreigners use over sea in America, and I&rsquo;m rarely fell
      on seeing them and having a holiday look round Lunnon town. So as there
      ain&rsquo;t not nothing particler a-doing, if you hain&rsquo;t got
      anything to say agin it, I think I&rsquo;ll go, Squire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the Squire; &ldquo;are you going to take
      your wife with you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why no, Squire; I said as I wanted to go for a holiday, and that
      ain&rsquo;t no holiday to take the old missus too,&rdquo; and George
      chuckled in a manner which evidently meant volumes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it came to pass that on the afternoon of the day of the transfer of
      the mortgages from Edward Cossey to Mr. Quest the great George found
      himself wandering vaguely about the vast expanse of the Colinderies, and
      not enjoying himself in the least. He had been recommended by some
      travelled individual in Boisingham to a certain lodging near Liverpool
      Street Station, which he found with the help of a friendly porter. Thence
      he set out for the Exhibition, but, being of a prudent mind, thought that
      he would do well to save his money and walk the distance. So he walked and
      walked till he was tired, and then, after an earnest consultation with a
      policeman, he took a &lsquo;bus, which an hour later landed him&mdash;at
      the Royal Oak. His further adventures we need not pursue; suffice it to
      say that, having started from his lodging at three, it was past seven o&rsquo;clock
      at night when he finally reached the Exhibition, more thoroughly wearied
      than though he had done a good day&rsquo;s harvesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he wandered for a while in continual dread of having his pocket
      picked, seeking reaping machines and discovering none, till at length he
      found himself in the gardens, where the electric light display was in full
      swing. Soon wearying of this, for it was a cold damp night, he made a
      difficult path to a buffet inside the building, where he sat down at a
      little table, and devoured some very unpleasant-looking cold beef. Here
      slumber overcame him, for his weariness was great, and he dozed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently through the muffled roar and hum of voices which echoed in his
      sleep-dulled ears, he caught the sound of a familiar name, that woke him
      up &ldquo;all of a heap,&rdquo; as he afterwards said. The name was
      &ldquo;Quest.&rdquo; Without moving his body he opened his eyes. At the
      very next table to his own were seated two people, a man and a woman. He
      looked at the latter first. She was clad in yellow, and was very tall,
      thin and fierce-looking; so fierce-looking that George involuntarily
      jerked his head back, and brought it with painful force in contact with
      the wall. It was the Tiger herself, and her companion was the coarse,
      dreadful-looking man called Johnnie, whom she had sent away in the cab on
      the night of Mr. Quest&rsquo;s visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Johnnie was saying, &ldquo;so Quest is his name, is it,
      and he lives in a city called Boisingham, does he? Is he an off bird?&rdquo;
      (rich)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather,&rdquo; answered the Tiger, &ldquo;if only one can make the
      dollars run, but he&rsquo;s a nasty mean boy, he is. Look here, not a
      cent, not a stiver have I got to bless myself with, and I daren&rsquo;t
      ask him for any more not till January. And how am I going to live till
      January? I got the sack from the music hall last week because I was a bit
      jolly. And now I can&rsquo;t get another billet any way, and there&rsquo;s
      a bill of sale over the furniture, and I&rsquo;ve sold all my jewels down
      to my ticker, or at least most of them, and there&rsquo;s that brute,&rdquo;
      and her voice rose to a subdued scream, &ldquo;living like a fighting-cock
      while his poor wife is left to starve.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Wife!&rsquo; Oh, yes, we know all about that,&rdquo; said
      the gentleman called Johnnie.
    </p>
    <p>
      A look of doubt and cunning passed across the woman&rsquo;s face.
      Evidently she feared that she had said too much. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a
      good a name as another,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t I wish
      that I could get a grip of him; I&rsquo;d wring him,&rdquo; and she
      twisted her long bony hands as washerwomen do when they squeeze a cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d back you to,&rdquo; said Johnnie. &ldquo;And now, adored
      Edithia, I&rsquo;ve had enough of this blooming show, and I&rsquo;m off.
      Perhaps I shall look in down Rupert Street way this evening. Ta-ta.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you may as well stand a drink first,&rdquo; said the adored
      one. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty dry, I can tell you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, with pleasure; I will order one. Waiter, a
      brandy-and-soda for this lady&mdash;<i>six</i> of brandy, if you please;
      she&rsquo;s very delicate and wants support.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiter grinned and brought the drink and the man Johnnie turned round
      as though to pay him, but really he went without doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      George watched him go, and then looked again at the lady, whose appearance
      seemed to fascinate him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if that ain&rsquo;t a master one,&rdquo; he said to himself,
      &ldquo;and she called herself his wife, she did, and then drew up like a
      slug&rsquo;s horns. Hang me if I don&rsquo;t stick to her till I find out
      a bit more of the tale.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus ruminated George, who, be it observed, was no fool, and who had a
      hearty dislike and mistrust of Mr. Quest. While he was wondering how he
      was to go to work an unexpected opportunity occurred. The lady had
      finished her brandy-and-soda, and was preparing to leave, when the waiter
      swooped down upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money please, miss,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;why you&rsquo;re paid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, none of that,&rdquo; said the waiter. &ldquo;I want a
      shilling for the brandy-and-soda.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A shilling, do you? Then you&rsquo;ll have to want, you cheating
      white-faced rascal you; my friend paid you before he went away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ve had too much of that game,&rdquo; said the waiter,
      beckoning to a constable, to whom, in spite of the &ldquo;fair Edithia&rsquo;s&rdquo;
      very vigorous and pointed protestations, he went on to give her in charge,
      for it appeared that she had only twopence about her. This was George&rsquo;s
      opportunity, and he interfered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, marm,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the fat gent with you
      was a-playing of a little game. He only pretinded to pay the waiter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Playing a game, was he?&rdquo; gasped the infuriated Tiger. &ldquo;If
      I don&rsquo;t play a little game on him when I get a chance my name is not
      Edith d&rsquo;Aubigne, the nasty mean beast&mdash;the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me, marm,&rdquo; said George, putting a shilling on the
      table, which the waiter took and went away. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear to
      see a real lady like you in difficulty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you are a gentleman, you are,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, marm. That&rsquo;s my way. And now, marm, won&rsquo;t
      you have another?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No objection was raised by the lady, who had another, with the result that
      she became if not exactly tipsy at any rate not far off it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after this the building was cleared, and George found himself
      standing in Exhibition Road with the woman on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to give me a lift home, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
      she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, marm, for sure I am,&rdquo; said George, sighing as he thought
      of the cab fare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly they got into a hansom, and Mrs. d&rsquo;Aubigne having given
      the address in Pimlico, of which George instantly made a mental note, they
      started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in and have a drink,&rdquo; she said when they arrived, and
      accordingly he paid the cab&mdash;half-a-crown it cost him&mdash;and was
      ushered by the woman with a simper into the gilded drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the Tiger had another brandy-and-soda, after which George thought
      that she was about in a fit state for him to prosecute his inquiries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful place this Lunnon, marm; I niver was up here afore and
      had no idea that I should find folks so friendly. As I was a saying to my
      friend Laryer Quest down at Boisingham yesterday&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do you know the
      old man?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you means Laryer Quest, why in course I do, and Mrs. Quest too.
      Ah! she&rsquo;s a pretty one, she is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the lady burst into a flood of incoherent abuse which tired her so
      much that she had a fourth brandy-and-soda; George mixed it for her and he
      mixed it strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he rich?&rdquo; she asked as she put down the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Laryer Quest? Well I should say that he is about the warmest
      man in our part of the county.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here am I starving,&rdquo; burst out the horrible woman with a
      flood of drunken tears. &ldquo;Starving without a shilling to pay for a
      cab or a drink while my wedded husband lives in luxury with another woman.
      You tell him that I won&rsquo;t stand it; you tell him that if he don&rsquo;t
      find a &lsquo;thou.&rsquo; pretty quick I&rsquo;ll let him know the reason
      why.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand, marm,&rdquo; said George; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
      a lady down in Boisingham as is the real Mrs. Quest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo; she shrieked, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a lie! He
      married me before he married her. I could have him in the dock to-morrow,
      and I would, too, if I wasn&rsquo;t afraid of him, and that&rsquo;s a
      fact.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, marm, come,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;draw it mild from that
      tap.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t believe me, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said the woman,
      on whom the liquor was now beginning to take its full effect; &ldquo;then
      I&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo; and she staggered to a desk, unlocked it and
      took from it a folded paper, which she opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a properly certified copy of a marriage certificate, or purported
      so to be; but George, who was not too quick at his reading, had only time
      to note the name Quest, and the church, St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s, Hackney,
      when she snatched it away from him and locked it up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t any business of
      yours. What right have you to come prying into the affairs of a poor lone
      woman?&rdquo; And she sat down upon the sofa beside him, threw her long
      arm round him, rested her painted face upon his shoulder and began to weep
      the tears of intoxication.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, blow me!&rdquo; said George to himself, &ldquo;if this ain&rsquo;t
      a master one! I wonder what my old missus would say if she saw me in this
      fix. I say, marm&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But at that moment the door opened, and in came Johnnie, who had evidently
      also been employing the interval in refreshing himself, for he rolled like
      a ship in a sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and who the deuce are you? Come get
      out of this, you Methody parson-faced clodhopper, you. Fairest Edithia,
      what means this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the fairest Edithia had realised who her visitor was, and the
      trick whereby he had left her to pay for the brandy-and-soda recurring to
      her mind she sprang up and began to express her opinion of Johnnie in
      violent and libellous language. He replied in appropriate terms, as
      according to the newspaper reports people whose healths are proposed
      always do, and fast and furious grew the fun. At length, however, it
      seemed to occur to Johnnie that he, George, was in some way responsible
      for this state of affairs, for without word or warning he hit him on the
      nose. This proved too much for George&rsquo;s Christian forbearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would, you lubber! would you?&rdquo; he said, and sprang at
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Johnnie was big and fat, but Johnnie was rather drunk, and George was
      tough and exceedingly strong. In almost less time that it takes to write
      it he grasped the abominable Johnnie by the scruff of the neck and had
      with a mighty jerk hauled him over the sofa so that he lay face downwards
      thereon. By the door quite convenient to his hand stood George&rsquo;s
      ground ash stick, a peculiarly good and well-grown one which he had cut
      himself in Honham wood. He seized it. &ldquo;Now, boar,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you how we do the trick where I come from,&rdquo;
      and he laid on without mercy. <i>Whack! whack! whack!</i> came the ground
      ash on Johnnie&rsquo;s tight clothes. He yelled, swore and struggled in
      the grip of the sturdy countryman, but it was of no use, the ash came down
      like fate; never was a Johnnie so bastinadoed before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it the brute, give it him,&rdquo; shrilled the fair Edithia,
      bethinking her of her wrongs, and he did till he was tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Johnnie boar,&rdquo; he panted at last, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      thinking I&rsquo;ve pretty nigh whacked you to dead. Perhaps you&rsquo;ll
      larn to be more careful how you handles your betters by-and-by.&rdquo;
      Then seizing his hat he ran down the stairs without seeing anybody and
      slipping into the street crossed over and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were at it again. Seeing her enemy prostrate the Tiger had fallen on
      him, with the fire-irons to judge from the noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then a policeman hurried up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, master,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;the folk in that there
      house with the red pillars do fare to be a murdering of each other.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The policeman listened to the din and then made for the house. Profiting
      by his absence George retreated as fast as he could, his melancholy
      countenance shining with sober satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following morning, before he returned to Honham, George paid a
      visit to St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s Church, Hackney. Here he made certain
      investigations in the registers, the results of which were not
      unsatisfactory to him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX. &mdash; EDWARD COSSEY MEETS WITH AN ACCIDENT
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the best of times this is not a gay world, though no doubt we ought to
      pretend that humanity at large is as happy as it is represented to be in,
      let us say, the Christmas number of an illustrated paper. How well we can
      imagine the thoughtful inhabitant of this country Anno Domini 7500 or
      thereabouts disinterring from the crumbling remains of a fireproof safe a
      Christmas number of the <i>Illustrated London News</i> or the <i>Graphic</i>.
      The archaic letters would perhaps be unintelligible to him, but he would
      look at the pictures with much the same interest that we regard bushmen&rsquo;s
      drawings or the primitive clay figures of Peru, and though his whole
      artistic seventy-sixth century soul would be revolted at the crudeness of
      the colouring, surely he would moralise thus: &ldquo;Oh, happy race of
      primitive men, how I, the child of light and civilisation, envy you your
      long-forgotten days! Here in these rude drawings, which in themselves
      reveal the extraordinary capacity for pleasure possessed by the early
      races, who could look upon them and gather gratification from the sight,
      may we trace your joyous career from the cradle to the grave. Here you
      figure as a babe, at whose appearance everybody seems delighted, even
      those of your race whose inheritance will be thereby diminished&mdash;and
      here a merry lad you revel in the school which the youth of our age finds
      so wearisome. There, grown more old, you stand at the altar of a beautiful
      lost faith, a faith that told of hope and peace beyond the grave, and by
      you stands your blushing bride. No hard fate, no considerations of means,
      no worldly-mindedness, come to snatch you from her arms as now they daily
      do. With her you spend your peaceful days, and here at last we see you old
      but surrounded by love and tender kindness, and almost looking forward to
      that grave which you believed would be but the gate of glory. Oh, happy
      race of simple-minded men, what a commentary upon our fevered, avaricious,
      pleasure-seeking age is this rude scroll of primitive and infantile art!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So will some unborn <i>laudator temporis acti</i> speak in some dim
      century to be, when our sorrows have faded and are not.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, though we do not put a record of them in our Christmas numbers,
      troubles are as troubles have been and will continually be, for however
      apparently happy the lot of individuals, it is not altogether a cheerful
      world in which we have been called to live. At any rate so thought Harold
      Quaritch on that night of the farewell scene with Ida in the churchyard,
      and so he continued to think for some time to come. A man&rsquo;s life is
      always more or less a struggle; he is a swimmer upon an adverse sea, and
      to live at all he must keep his limbs in motion. If he grows faint-hearted
      or weary and no longer strives, for a little while he floats, and then at
      last, morally or physically, he vanishes. We struggle for our livelihoods,
      and for all that makes life worth living in the material sense, and not
      the less are we called upon to struggle with an army of spiritual woes and
      fears, which now we vanquish and now are vanquished by. Every man of
      refinement, and many women, will be able to recall periods in his or her
      existence when life has seemed not only valueless but hateful, when our
      small successes, such as they are, dwindled away and vanished in the gulf
      of our many failures, when our hopes and aspirations faded like a little
      sunset cloud, and we were surrounded by black and lonely mental night,
      from which even the star of Faith had passed. Such a time had come to
      Harold Quaritch now. His days had not, on the whole, been happy days; but
      he was a good and earnest man, with that touching faith in Providence
      which is given to some among us, and which had brought with it the reward
      of an even thankful spirit. And then, out of the dusk of his contentment a
      hope of happiness had arisen like the Angel of the Dawn, and suddenly life
      was aflame with the light of love, and became beautiful in his eyes. And
      now the hope had passed: the woman whom he deeply loved, and who loved him
      back again, had gone from his reach and left him desolate&mdash;gone from
      his reach, not into the grave, but towards the arms of another man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our race is called upon to face many troubles; sickness, poverty, and
      death, but it is doubtful if Evil holds another arrow so sharp as that
      which pierced him now. He was no longer young, it is true, and therefore
      did not feel that intense agony of disappointed passion, that sickening
      sense of utter loss which in such circumstances sometimes settle on the
      young. But if in youth we feel more sharply and with a keener sympathy of
      the imagination, we have at least more strength to bear, and hope does not
      altogether die. For we know that we shall live it down, or if we do not
      know it then, we <i>do</i> live it down. Very likely, indeed, there comes
      a time when we look back upon our sorrow and he or she who caused it with
      wonder, yes even with scorn and bitter laughter. But it is not so when the
      blow falls in later life. It may not hurt so much at the time, it may seem
      to have been struck with the bludgeon of Fate rather than with her keen
      dividing sword, but the effect is more lasting, and for the rest of our
      days we are numb and cold, for Time has no salve to heal us.
    </p>
    <p>
      These things Harold realised most clearly in the heavy days which followed
      that churchyard separation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took his punishment like a brave man indeed, and went about his daily
      occupations with a steadfast face, but his bold behaviour did not lessen
      its weight. He had promised not to go away till Ida was married and he
      would keep the promise, but in his heart he wondered how he should bear
      the sight of her. What would it be to see her, to touch her hand, to hear
      the rustle of her dress and the music of her beloved voice, and to realise
      again and yet again that all these things were not for him, that they had
      passed from him into the ownership of another man?
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day following that upon which Edward Cossey had been terrified into
      transferring the Honham mortgages to Mr. Quest the Colonel went out
      shooting. He had lately become the possessor of a new hammerless gun by a
      well-known London maker, of which he stood in considerable need. Harold
      had treated himself to this gun when he came into his aunt&rsquo;s little
      fortune, but it was only just completed. The weapon was a beautiful one,
      and at any other time it would have filled his sportsman&rsquo;s heart
      with joy. Even as it was, when he put it together and balanced it and took
      imaginary shots at blackbirds in the garden, for a little while he forgot
      his sorrows, for the woe must indeed be heavy which a new hammerless gun
      by such a maker cannot do something towards lightening. So on the next
      morning he took this gun and went to the marshes by the river&mdash;where,
      he was credibly informed, several wisps of snipe had been seen&mdash;to
      attempt to shoot some of them and put the new weapon to the test.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on this same morning that Edward Cossey got a letter which
      disturbed him not a little. It was from Belle Quest, and ran thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Mr. Cossey,&mdash;Will you come over and see me this afternoon
      about three o&rsquo;clock? I shall <i>expect</i> you, so I am sure you
      will not disappoint me.&mdash;B.Q.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long while he hesitated what to do. Belle Quest was at the present
      juncture the very last person whom he wished to see. His nerves were
      shaken and he feared a scene, but on the other hand he did not know what
      danger might threaten him if he refused to go. Quest had got his price,
      and he knew that he had nothing more to fear from him; but a jealous woman
      has no price, and if he did not humour her it might, he felt, be at a risk
      which he could not estimate. Also he was nervously anxious to give no
      further cause for gossip. A sudden outward and visible cessation of his
      intimacy with the Quests might, he thought, give rise to surmises and
      suspicion in a little country town like Boisingham, where all his
      movements were known. So, albeit with a faint heart, he determined to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, at three o&rsquo;clock precisely, he was shown into the
      drawing-room at the Oaks. Mrs. Quest was not there; indeed he waited for
      ten minutes before she came in. She was pale, so pale that the blue veins
      on her forehead showed distinctly through her ivory skin, and there was a
      curious intensity about her manner which frightened him. She was very
      quiet also, unnaturally so, indeed; but her quiet was of the ominous
      nature of the silence before the storm, and when she spoke her words were
      keen, and quick, and vivid.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not shake hands with him, but sat down and looked at him, slowly
      fanning herself with a painted ivory fan which she took up from the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sent for me, Belle, and here I am,&rdquo; he said, breaking the
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she spoke. &ldquo;You told me the other day,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that
      you were not engaged to be married to Ida de la Molle. It is not true. You
      are engaged to be married to her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who said so?&rdquo; he asked defiantly. &ldquo;Quest, I suppose?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it on a better authority,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I have
      it from Miss de la Molle herself. Now, listen, Edward Cossey. When I let
      you go, I made a condition, and that condition was that you should <i>not</i>
      marry Ida de la Molle. Do you still intend to marry her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had it from Ida,&rdquo; he said, disregarding her question;
      &ldquo;then you must have spoken to Ida&mdash;you must have told her
      everything. I suspected as much from her manner the other night. You&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is true,&rdquo; she broke in coldly. &ldquo;It is true, and
      in addition to your other failings, Edward, you are a coward and&mdash;a
      liar.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it to you what I am or what I am not?&rdquo; he answered
      savagely. &ldquo;What business is it of yours? You have no hold over me,
      and no claim upon me. As it is I have suffered enough at your hands and at
      those of your accursed husband. I have had to pay him thirty thousand
      pounds, do you know that? But of course you know it. No doubt the whole
      thing is a plant, and you will share the spoil.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ah!</i>&rdquo; she said, drawing a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now look here,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Once and for all, I
      will not be interfered with by you. I <i>am</i> engaged to marry Ida de la
      Molle, and whether you wish it or no I shall marry her. And one more
      thing. I will not allow you to associate with Ida. Do you understand me? I
      will not allow it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been holding the fan before her face while he spoke. Now she
      lowered it and looked at him. Her face was paler than ever, paler than
      death, if that be possible, but in her eyes there shone a light like the
      light of a flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he answered savagely. &ldquo;I wonder that you
      think it necessary to ask such a question, but as you do I will tell you
      why. Because Ida is the lady whom I am going to marry, and I do not choose
      that she should associate with a woman who is what you are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ah!</i>&rdquo; she said again, &ldquo;I understand now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment a diversion occurred. The drawing-room looked on to the
      garden, and at the end of the garden was a door which opened into another
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this door had come Colonel Quaritch accompanied by Mr. Quest, the
      former with his gun under his arm. They walked up the garden and were
      almost at the French window when Edward Cossey saw them. &ldquo;Control
      yourself,&rdquo; he said in a low voice, &ldquo;here is your husband.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Quest advanced and knocked at the window, which his wife opened. When
      he saw Edward Cossey he hesitated a little, then nodded to him, while the
      Colonel came forward, and placing his gun by the wall entered the room,
      shook hands with Mrs. Quest, and bowed coldly to Edward Cossey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met the Colonel, Belle,&rdquo; said Mr. Quest, &ldquo;coming here
      with the benevolent intention of giving you some snipe, so I brought him
      up by the short way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very kind of you, Colonel Quaritch,&rdquo; said she with a
      sweet smile (for she had the sweetest smile imaginable).
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her. There was something about her face which attracted his
      attention, something unusual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you looking at?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You,&rdquo; he said bluntly, for they were out of hearing of the
      other two. &ldquo;If I were poetically minded I should say that you looked
      like the Tragic Muse.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I?&rdquo; she answered, laughing. &ldquo;Well, that is curious,
      because I feel like Comedy herself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something wrong with that woman,&rdquo; thought the
      Colonel to himself as he extracted two couple of snipe from his capacious
      coat tails. &ldquo;I wonder what it is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then Mr. Quest and Edward Cossey passed out into the garden talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are the snipe, Mrs. Quest,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have had
      rather good luck. I killed four couple and missed two couple more; but
      then I had a new gun, and one can never shoot so well with a new gun.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;do pull out the &lsquo;painters&rsquo;
      for me. I like to put them in my riding hat, and I can never find them
      myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but I must go into the garden
      to do it; there is not light enough here. It gets dark so soon now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly he stepped out through the window, and began to hunt for the
      pretty little feathers which are to be found at the angle of a snipe&rsquo;s
      wing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the new gun, Colonel Quaritch?&rdquo; said Mrs. Quest
      presently; &ldquo;what a beautiful one!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t taken the
      cartridges out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had been looking at her, which at that moment he was not, Harold
      would have seen her stagger and catch at the wall for support. Then he
      would have seen an awful and malevolent light of sudden determination pass
      across her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I know about guns. My father
      used to shoot and I often cleaned his gun,&rdquo; and she took the weapon
      up and began to examine the engraving on the locks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; she said, pointing to a little slide above the
      locks on which the word &ldquo;safe&rdquo; was engraved in gold letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s the safety bolt,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When you
      see the word &lsquo;safe,&rsquo; the locks are barred and the gun won&rsquo;t
      go off. You have to push the bolt forward before you can fire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So?&rdquo; she said carelessly, and suiting the action to the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, so, but please be careful, the gun is loaded.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll be careful,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Well, it is
      a very pretty gun, and so light that I believe I could shoot with it
      myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Edward Cossey and Mr. Quest, who were walking up the garden, had
      separated, Mr. Quest going to the right across the lawn to pick up a glove
      which had dropped upon the grass, while Edward Cossey slowly sauntered
      towards them. When he was about nine paces off he too halted and, stooping
      a little, looked abstractedly at a white Japanese chrysanthemum which was
      still in bloom. Mrs. Quest turned, as the Colonel thought, to put the gun
      back against the wall. He would have offered to take it from her but at
      the moment both his hands were occupied in extracting one of the &ldquo;painters&rdquo;
      from a snipe. The next thing he was aware of was a loud explosion,
      followed by an exclamation or rather a cry from Mrs. Quest. He dropped the
      snipe and looked up, just in time to see the gun, which had leapt from her
      hands with the recoil, strike against the wall of the house and fall to
      the ground. Instantly, whether by instinct or by chance he never knew, he
      glanced towards the place where Edward Cossey stood, and saw that his face
      was streaming with blood and that his right arm hung helpless by his side.
      Even as he looked, he saw him put his uninjured hand to his head, and,
      without a word or a sound, sink down on the gravel path.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a second there was silence, and the blue smoke from the gun hung
      heavily upon the damp autumn air. In the midst of it stood Belle Quest
      like one transfixed, her lips apart, her blue eyes opened wide, and the
      stamp of terror&mdash;or was it guilt?&mdash;upon her pallid face.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this he saw in a flash, and then ran to the bleeding heap upon the
      gravel.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached it almost simultaneously with Mr. Quest, and together they
      turned the body over. But still Belle stood there enveloped in the heavy
      smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, however, her trance left her and she ran up, flung herself upon
      her knees, and looked at her former lover, whose face and head were now a
      mass of blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is dead,&rdquo; she wailed; &ldquo;he is dead, and I have killed
      him! Oh, Edward! Edward!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Quest turned on her savagely; so savagely that one might almost have
      thought he feared lest in her agony she should say something further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop that,&rdquo; he said, seizing her arm, &ldquo;and go for the
      doctor, for if he is not dead he will soon bleed to death.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With an effort she rose, put her hand to her forehead, and then ran like
      the wind down the garden and through the little door.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX. &mdash; HAROLD TAKES THE NEWS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Quest and Harold bore the bleeding man&mdash;whether he was senseless
      or dead they knew not&mdash;into the house and laid him on the sofa. Then,
      having despatched a servant to seek a second doctor in case the one
      already gone for was out, they set to work to cut the clothes from his
      neck and arm, and do what they could, and that was little enough, towards
      staunching the bleeding. It soon, however, became evident that Cossey had
      only got the outside portion of the charge of No. 7 that is to say, he had
      been struck by about a hundred pellets of the three or four hundred which
      would go to the ordinary ounce and an eighth. Had he received the whole
      charge he must, at that distance, have been instantly killed. As it was,
      the point of the shoulder was riddled, and so to a somewhat smaller extent
      was the back of his neck and the region of the right ear. One or two
      outside pellets had also struck the head higher up, and the skin and
      muscles along the back were torn by the passage of shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; said Mr. Quest, &ldquo;I think he is done for.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel nodded. He had some experience of shot wounds, and the present
      was not of a nature to encourage hope of the patient&rsquo;s survival.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did it happen?&rdquo; asked Mr. Quest presently, as he mopped
      up the streaming blood with a sponge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was an accident,&rdquo; groaned the Colonel. &ldquo;Your wife
      was looking at my new gun. I told her it was loaded, and that she must be
      careful, and I thought she had put it down. The next thing that I heard
      was the report. It is all my cursed fault for leaving the cartridges in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Mr. Quest. &ldquo;She always thought she understood
      guns. It is a shocking accident.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then one of the doctors, followed by Belle Quest, ran up the lawn
      carrying a box of instruments, and in another minute was at work. He was a
      quick and skilful surgeon, and having announced that the patient was not
      dead, at once began to tie one of the smaller arteries in the throat,
      which had been pierced, and through which Edward Cossey was rapidly
      bleeding to death. By the time that this was done the other doctor, an
      older man, put in an appearance, and together they made a rapid
      examination of the injuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Belle stood by holding a basin of water. She did not speak, and on her
      face was that same fixed look of horror which Harold had observed after
      the discharge of the gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the examination was finished the two doctors whispered together for a
      few seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he live?&rdquo; asked Mr. Quest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We cannot say,&rdquo; answered the older doctor. &ldquo;We do not
      think it likely that he will. It depends upon the extent of his injuries,
      and whether or no they have extended to the spine. If he does live he will
      probably be paralysed to some extent, and must certainly lose the hearing
      of the right ear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When she heard this Belle sank down upon a chair overwhelmed. Then the two
      doctors, assisted by Harold, set to work to carry Edward Cossey into
      another room which had been rapidly prepared, leaving Mr. Quest alone with
      his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came, stood in front of her, looked her in the face, and then laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we men are bad enough, but you
      women beat us in wickedness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she said faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that you are a murderess, Belle,&rdquo; he said solemnly.
      &ldquo;And you are a bungler, too. You could not hold the gun straight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I deny it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the gun went off&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are wise to make no admissions;
      they might be used in evidence against you. Let me counsel you to make no
      admissions. But now look here. I suppose the man will have to lie in this
      house until he recovers or dies, and that you will help to nurse him.
      Well, I will have none of your murderous work going on here. Do you hear
      me? You are not to complete at leisure what you have begun in haste.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you take me for?&rdquo; she asked, with some return of
      spirit; &ldquo;do you think that I would injure a wounded man?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; he answered, with a shrug, &ldquo;and as for
      what I take you for, I take you for a woman whose passion has made her
      mad,&rdquo; and he turned and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had carried Edward Cossey, dead or alive&mdash;and he looked
      more like death than life&mdash;up to the room prepared for him, seeing
      that he could be of no further use the Colonel left the house with a view
      of going to the Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his way out he looked into the drawing-room and there was Mrs. Quest,
      still sitting on the chair and gazing blankly before her. Pitying her he
      entered. &ldquo;Come, cheer up, Mrs. Quest,&rdquo; he said kindly, &ldquo;they
      hope that he will live.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is an awful accident, but I am almost as culpable as you, for I
      left the cartridges in the gun. Anyhow, God&rsquo;s will be done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God&rsquo;s will!&rdquo; she said, looking up, and then once more
      relapsed into silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to go, when suddenly she rose and caught him by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he die?&rdquo; she said almost fiercely. &ldquo;Tell me what
      you think&mdash;not what the doctors say; you have seen many wounded men
      and know better than they do. Tell me the truth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot say,&rdquo; he answered, shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently she interpreted his answer in the affirmative. At any rate she
      covered her face with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you do, Colonel Quaritch, if you had killed the only
      thing you loved in the whole world?&rdquo; she asked dreamily. &ldquo;Oh,
      what am I saying?&mdash;I am off my head. Leave me&mdash;go and tell Ida;
      it will be good news for Ida.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly he started for the Castle, having first picked up his gun on
      the spot where it had fallen from the hands of Mrs. Quest.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then it was that for the first time the extraordinary importance of
      this dreadful accident in its bearing upon his own affairs flashed upon
      his mind. If Cossey died he could not marry Ida, that was clear. This was
      what Mrs. Quest must have meant when she said that it would be good news
      for Ida. But how did she know anything about Ida&rsquo;s engagement to
      Edward Cossey? And, by Jove! what did the woman mean when she asked what
      he would do if he had killed the only thing he loved in the world? Cossey
      must be the &ldquo;only thing she loved,&rdquo; and now he thought of it,
      when she believed that he was dead she called him &ldquo;Edward, Edward.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold Quaritch was as simple and unsuspicious a man as it would be easy
      to find, but he was no fool. He had moved about the world and on various
      occasions come in contact with cases of this sort, as most other men have
      done. He knew that when a woman, in a moment of distress, calls a man by
      his Christian name it is because she is in the habit of thinking of him
      and speaking to him by that name. Not that there was much in that by
      itself, but in public she called him &ldquo;Mr. Cossey.&rdquo; &ldquo;Edward&rdquo;
      clearly then was the &ldquo;only thing she loved,&rdquo; and Edward was
      secretly engaged to Ida, and Mrs. Quest knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now when a man who is not her husband has the fortune, or rather the
      misfortune, to be the only thing a married woman ever loved, and when that
      married woman is aware of the fact of his devotion and engagement to
      somebody else, it is obvious, he reflected, that in nine cases out of ten
      the knowledge will excite strong feelings in her breast, feelings indeed
      which in some natures would amount almost to madness.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had first seen Mrs. Quest that afternoon she and Cossey were alone
      together, and he had noticed something unusual about her, something
      unnatural and intense. Indeed, he remembered he had told her that she
      looked like the Tragic Muse. Could it be that the look was the look of a
      woman maddened by insult and jealousy, who was meditating some fearful
      crime? <i>How did that gun go off?</i> He did not see it, and he thanked
      heaven that he did not, for we are not always so anxious to bring our
      fellow creatures to justice as we might be, especially when they happen to
      be young and lovely women. How did it go off? She understood guns; he
      could see that from the way she handled it. Was it likely that it exploded
      of itself, or owing to an accidental touch of the trigger? It was
      possible, but not likely. Still, such things have been known to happen,
      and it would be very difficult to prove that it had not happened in this
      case. If it should be attempted murder it was very cleverly managed,
      because nobody could prove that it was not accidental. But could it be
      that this soft, beautiful, baby-faced woman had on the spur of the moment
      taken advantage of his loaded gun to wreak her jealousy and her wrongs
      upon her faithless lover? Well, the face is no mirror of the quality of
      the soul within, and it was possible. Further than that it did not seem to
      him to be his business to inquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time he had reached the Castle. The Squire had gone out but Ida
      was in, and he was shown into the drawing-room while the servant went to
      seek her. Presently he heard her dress rustle upon the stairs, and the
      sound of it sent the blood to his heart, for where is the music that is
      more sweet than the rustling of the dress of the woman whom we love?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what is the matter?&rdquo; she said, noticing the disturbed
      expression on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there has been an accident&mdash;a
      very bad accident.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Not my father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; Mr. Cossey.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, with a sigh of relief. &ldquo;Why did you
      frighten me so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel smiled grimly at this unconscious exhibition of the relative
      state of her affections.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened to him?&rdquo; asked Ida, this time with a
      suitable expression of concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been accidentally shot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who by?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Quest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she did it on purpose&mdash;I mean&mdash;is he dead?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I believe that he will die.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked at one another, and each read in the eyes of the other the
      thought which passed through their brains. If Edward Cossey died they
      would be free to marry. So clearly did they read it that Ida actually
      interpreted it in words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not think that,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it is very wrong.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is wrong,&rdquo; answered the Colonel, apparently in no way
      surprised at her interpretation of his thoughts, &ldquo;but unfortunately
      human nature is human nature.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he went on to tell her all about it. Ida made no comment, that is
      after those first words, &ldquo;she did it on purpose,&rdquo; which burst
      from her in astonishment. She felt, and he felt too, that the question as
      to how that gun went off was one which was best left uninquired into by
      them. No doubt if the man died there would be an inquest, and the whole
      matter would be investigated. Meanwhile one thing was certain, Edward
      Cossey, whom she was engaged to, was shot and likely to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, while they were still talking, the Squire came in from his
      walk. To him also the story was told, and to judge from the expression of
      his face he thought it grave enough. If Edward Cossey died the mortgages
      over the Honham property would, as he believed, pass to his heir, who,
      unless he had made a will, which was not probable, would be his father,
      old Mr. Cossey, the banker, from whom Mr. de la Molle well knew he had
      little mercy to expect. This was serious enough, and still more serious
      was it that all the bright prospects in which he had for some days been
      basking of the re-establishment of his family upon a securer basis than it
      had occupied for generations would vanish like a vision. He was not more
      worldly-minded than are other men, but he did fondly cherish a natural
      desire to see the family fortunes once more in the ascendant. The
      projected marriage between his daughter and Edward Cossey would have
      brought this about most fully, and however much he might in his secret
      heart distrust the man himself, and doubt whether the match was really
      acceptable to Ida, he could not view its collapse with indifference. While
      they were still talking the dressing-bell rang, and Harold rose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop and dine, won&rsquo;t you, Quaritch?&rdquo; said the Squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold hesitated and looked at Ida. She made no movement, but her eyes
      said &ldquo;stay,&rdquo; and he sighed and yielded. Dinner was rather a
      melancholy feast, for the Squire was preoccupied with his own thoughts,
      and Ida had not much to say. So far as the Colonel was concerned, the
      recollection of the tragedy he had witnessed that afternoon, and of all
      the dreadful details with which it was accompanied, was not conducive to
      appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as dinner was over the Squire announced that he should walk into
      Boisingham to inquire how the wounded man was getting on. Shortly
      afterwards he started, leaving his daughter and Harold alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went into the drawing-room and talked about indifferent things. No
      word of love passed between them; no word, even, that could bear an
      affectionate significance, and yet every sentence which passed their lips
      carried a message with it, and was as heavy with unuttered tenderness as a
      laden bee with honey. For they loved each other dearly, and deep love is a
      thing that can hardly be concealed by lovers from each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was happiness for him merely to sit beside her and hear her speak, to
      watch the changes of her face and the lamplight playing upon her hair, and
      it was happiness for her to know that he was sitting there and watching.
      For the most beautiful aspect of true affection is its accompanying sense
      of perfect companionship and rest. It is a sense which nothing else in
      this life can give, and, like a lifting cloud, reveals the white and
      distant peaks of that unbroken peace which we cannot hope to win in our
      stormy journey through the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the evening wore away till at last they heard the Squire&rsquo;s
      loud voice talking to somebody outside. Presently he came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is he?&rdquo; asked Harold. &ldquo;Will he live?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They cannot say,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;But two great
      doctors have been telegraphed for from London, and will be down to-morrow.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI. &mdash; IDA RECANTS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The two great doctors came, and the two great doctors pocketed their
      hundred guinea fees and went, but neither the one nor the other, nor eke
      the twain, would commit themselves to a fixed opinion as to Edward Cossey&rsquo;s
      chances of life or death. However, one of them picked out a number of shot
      from the wounded man, and a number more he left in because he could not
      pick them out. Then they both agreed that the treatment of their local
      brethren was all that could be desired, and so far as they were concerned
      there was an end of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week had passed, and Edward Cossey, nursed night and day by Belle Quest,
      still hovered between life and death.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a Thursday, and Harold had walked up to the Castle to give the
      Squire the latest news of the wounded man. Whilst he was in the vestibule
      saying what he had to say to Mr. de la Molle and Ida, a man rung the bell,
      whom he recognised as one of Mr. Quest&rsquo;s clerks. He was shown in,
      and handed the Squire a fully-addressed brief envelope, which, he said, he
      had been told to deliver by Mr. Quest, and adding that there was no answer
      bowed himself out.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he had gone the envelope was opened by Mr. de la Molle, who
      took from it two legal-looking documents which he began to read. Suddenly
      the first dropped from his hand, and with an exclamation he snatched at
      the second.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, father?&rdquo; asked Ida.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it? Why it&rsquo;s just this. Edward Cossey has transferred
      the mortgages over this property to Quest, the lawyer, and Quest has
      served a notice on me calling in the money,&rdquo; and he began to walk up
      and down the room in a state of great agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand,&rdquo; said Ida, her breast
      heaving, and a curious light shining in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said her father, &ldquo;then perhaps you
      will read that,&rdquo; and he pushed the papers to her. As he did so
      another letter which he had not observed fell out of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point Harold rose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go, Quaritch, don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; said the Squire.
      &ldquo;I shall be glad of your advice, and I am sure that what you hear
      will not go any further.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time Ida motioned him to stay, and though somewhat unwillingly
      he did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Sir,&rdquo; began the Squire, reading the letter aloud,&mdash;
      &ldquo;Inclosed you will find the usual formal notices calling in the sum
      of thirty thousand pounds recently advanced upon the mortgage of the
      Honham Castle Estates by Edward Cossey, Esq. These mortgages have passed
      into my possession for value received, and it is now my desire to realise
      them. I most deeply regret being forced to press an old client, but my
      circumstances are such that I am obliged to do so. If I can in any way
      facilitate your efforts to raise the sum I shall be very glad. But in the
      event of the money not being forthcoming at the end of six months&rsquo;
      notice the ordinary steps will be taken to realise by foreclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, dear sir, yours truly, &ldquo;W. Quest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;James de la Molle, Esq., J.P., D.L.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see now,&rdquo; said Ida. &ldquo;Mr. Cossey has no further hold
      on the mortgages or on the property.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said the Squire; &ldquo;he has transferred
      them to that rascally lawyer. And yet he told me&mdash;I can&rsquo;t
      understand it, I really can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point the Colonel insisted upon leaving, saying he would call in
      again that evening to see if he could be of any assistance. When he was
      gone Ida spoke in a cold, determined voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Cossey told me that when we married he would put those
      mortgages in the fire. It now seems that the mortgages were not his to
      dispose of, or else that he has since transferred them to Mr. Quest
      without informing us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I suppose so,&rdquo; said the Squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Ida. &ldquo;And now, father, I will tell you
      something. I engaged myself&mdash;or, to be more accurate, I promised to
      engage myself&mdash;to Edward Cossey on the condition that he would take
      up these mortgages when Cossey and Son were threatening to foreclose, or
      whatever it is called.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; said her astonished father, &ldquo;what an
      idea!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did it,&rdquo; went on Ida, &ldquo;and he took up the mortgages,
      and in due course he claimed my promise, and I became engaged to marry
      him, though that engagement was repugnant to me. You will see that having
      persuaded him to advance the money I could not refuse to carry out my
      share of the bargain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Squire, &ldquo;this is all new to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;and I should never have told you
      of it had it not been for this sudden change in the position of affairs.
      What I did, I did to save our family from ruin. But now it seems that Mr.
      Cossey has played us false, and that we are to be ruined after all.
      Therefore, the condition upon which I promised to marry him has not been
      carried out, and my promise falls to the ground.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that supposing he lives, you will not marry Edward Cossey.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do mean it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire thought for a minute. &ldquo;This is a very serious step, Ida,&rdquo;
      he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that I think that the man has behaved
      well&mdash;but still he may have given up the mortgages to Quest under
      pressure of some sort and might be willing to find the money to meet them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not care if he finds the money ten times over,&rdquo; said
      Ida, &ldquo;I will not marry him. He has not kept to the letter of his
      bond and I will not keep to mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all very well, Ida,&rdquo; said the Squire, &ldquo;and of
      course nobody can force you into a distasteful marriage, but I wish to
      point out one thing. You have your family to think of as well as yourself.
      I tell you frankly that I do not believe that as times are it will be
      possible to raise thirty thousand pounds to pay off the charges unless it
      is by the help of Edward Cossey. So if he lives&mdash;and as he has lasted
      so long I expect that he will live&mdash;and you refuse to go on with your
      engagement to him we shall be sold up, that is all; for this man Quest,
      confound him, will show us no mercy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, father,&rdquo; answered Ida, &ldquo;but I cannot and
      will not marry him, and I do not think you can expect me to do so. I
      became engaged, or rather promised to become engaged to him, because I
      thought that one woman had no right to put her own happiness before the
      welfare of an old family like ours, and I would have carried out that
      engagement at any cost. But since then, to tell you the truth,&rdquo; and
      she blushed deeply, &ldquo;not only have I learned to dislike him a great
      deal more, but I have come to care for some one else who also cares for
      me, and who therefore has a right to be considered. Think, father, what it
      means to a woman to sell herself into bodily and mental bondage&mdash;when
      she cares for another man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said her father with some irritation, &ldquo;I
      am no authority upon matters of sentiment; they are not in my line and I
      know that women have their prejudices. Still you can&rsquo;t expect me to
      look at the matter in quite the same light as you do. And who is the
      gentleman? Colonel Quaritch?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the Squire, &ldquo;I have nothing to say against
      Quaritch, indeed I like the man, but I suppose that if he has 600 pounds a
      year, it is every sixpence he can count on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had rather marry him upon six hundred a year than Edward Cossey
      upon sixty thousand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, I have heard young women talk like that before, though
      perhaps they think differently afterwards. Of course I have no right to
      obtrude myself, but when you are comfortably married, what is going to
      become of Honham I should like to know, and incidentally of me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, father, dear,&rdquo; she answered, her eyes
      filling with tears; &ldquo;we must trust to Providence, I suppose. I know
      you think me very selfish,&rdquo; she went on, catching him by the arm,
      &ldquo;but, oh, father! there are things that are worse than death to
      women, or, at least, to some women. I almost think that I would rather die
      than marry Edward Cossey, though I should have gone through with it if he
      had kept his word.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said her father. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wonder at it,
      and certainly I do not ask you to marry a man whom you dislike. But still
      it is hard upon me to have all this trouble at my age, and the old place
      coming to the hammer too. It is enough to make a man wish that his worries
      were over altogether. However, we must take things as we find them, and we
      find them pretty rough. Quaritch said he was coming back this evening,
      didn&rsquo;t he? I suppose there will not be any public engagement at
      present, will there? And look here, Ida, I don&rsquo;t want him to come
      talking to me about it. I have got enough things of my own to think of
      without bothering my head with your love affairs. Pray let the matter be
      for the present. And now I am going out to see that fellow George, who
      hasn&rsquo;t been here since he came back from London, and a nice bit of
      news it will be that I shall have to tell him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When her father had gone Ida did a thing she had not done for some time&mdash;she
      wept a little. All her fine intentions of self-denial had broken down, and
      she felt humiliated at the fact. She had intended to sacrifice herself
      upon the altar of her duty and to make herself the wedded wife of a man
      whom she disliked, and now on the first opportunity she had thrown up the
      contract on a quibble&mdash;a point of law as it were. Nature had been too
      strong for her, as it often is for people with deep feelings; she could
      not do it, no, not to save Honham from the hammer. When she had promised
      that she would engage herself to Edward Cossey she had not been in love
      with Colonel Quaritch; now she was, and the difference between the two
      states is considerable. Still the fall humiliated her pride, and what is
      more she felt that her father was disappointed in her. Of course she could
      not expect him at his age to enter into her private feelings, for when
      looked at through the mist of years sentiment appears more or less
      foolish. She knew very well that age often strips men of those finer
      sympathies and sensibilities which clothe them in youth, much as the
      winter frost and wind strip the delicate foliage from the trees. And to
      such the music of the world is dead. Love has vanished with the summer
      dews, and in its place are cutting blasts and snows and sere memories
      rustling like fallen leaves about the feet. As we grow old we are too apt
      to grow away from beauty and what is high and pure, our hearts harden by
      contact with the hard world. We examine love and find, or believe we find,
      that it is nought but a variety of passion; friendship, and think it
      self-interest; religion, and name it superstition. The facts of life alone
      remain clear and desirable. We know that money means power, and we turn
      our face to Mammon, and if he smiles upon us we are content to let our
      finer visions go where our youth has gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trailing clouds of glory do we come From God, who is our home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So says the poet, but alas! the clouds soon melt into the grey air of the
      world, and some of us, before our course is finished, forget that they
      ever were. And yet which is the shadow of the truth&mdash;those dreams,
      and hopes, and aspirations of our younger life, or the corruption with
      which the world cakes our souls?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida knew that she could not expect her father to sympathise with her; she
      knew that to his judgment, circumstances being the same, and both suitors
      being equally sound in wind and limb, the choice of one of them should, to
      a large extent, be a matter to be decided by the exterior considerations
      of wealth and general convenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, she had made her choice, made it suddenly, but none the less had
      made it. It lay between her father&rsquo;s interest and the interest of
      the family at large and her own honour as a woman&mdash;for the mere empty
      ceremony of marriage which satisfies society cannot make dishonour an
      honourable thing. She had made her choice, and the readers of her history
      must judge if that choice was right or wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner Harold came again as he had promised. The Squire was not in
      the drawing-room when he was shown in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida rose to greet him with a sweet and happy smile upon her face, for in
      the presence of her lover all her doubts and troubles vanished like a
      mist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a piece of news for you,&rdquo; said he, trying to look as
      though he was rejoiced to give it. &ldquo;Edward Cossey has taken a
      wonderful turn for the better. They say that he will certainly recover.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she answered, colouring a little, &ldquo;and now I have
      a piece of news for you, Colonel Quaritch. My engagement with Mr. Edward
      Cossey is at an end. I shall not marry him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; said Harold with a gasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite sure. I have made up my mind,&rdquo; and she held out her
      hand, as though to seal her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took it and kissed it. &ldquo;Thank heaven, Ida,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;thank heaven;&rdquo; and at that
      moment the Squire came in, looking very miserable and depressed, and of
      course nothing more was said about the matter.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII. &mdash; GEORGE PROPHESIES AGAIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Six weeks passed, and in that time several things happened. In the first
      place the miserly old banker, Edward Cossey&rsquo;s father, had died, his
      death being accelerated by the shock of his son&rsquo;s accident. On his
      will being opened, it was found that property and money to no less a value
      than 600,000 pounds passed under it to Edward absolutely, the only
      condition attached being that he should continue in the house of Cossey
      and Son and leave a certain share of his fortune in the business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward Cossey also, thanks chiefly to Belle&rsquo;s tender nursing, had
      almost recovered, with one exception&mdash;he was, and would be for life,
      stone deaf in the right ear. The paralysis which the doctors feared had
      not shown itself. One of his first questions when he became convalescent
      was addressed to Belle Quest.
    </p>
    <p>
      As in a dream, he had always seen her sweet face hanging over him, and
      dimly known that she was ministering to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you nursed me ever since the accident, Belle?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very good of you, considering all things,&rdquo; he murmured.
      &ldquo;I wonder that you did not let me die.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But she turned her face to the wall and never said a word, nor did any
      further conversation on these matters pass between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then as his strength came back so did his passion for Ida de la Molle
      revive. He was not allowed to write or even receive letters, and with this
      explanation of her silence he was fain to content himself. But the Squire,
      he was told, often called to inquire after him, and once or twice Ida came
      with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length a time came&mdash;it was two days after he had been told of his
      father&rsquo;s death&mdash;when he was pronounced fit to be moved into his
      own rooms and to receive his correspondence as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      The move was effected without any difficulty, and here Belle bade him
      good-bye. Even as she did so George drove his fat pony up to the door, and
      getting down gave a letter to the landlady, with particular instructions
      that it was to be delivered into Mr. Cossey&rsquo;s own hands. As she
      passed Belle saw that it was addressed in the Squire&rsquo;s handwriting.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was delivered to him Edward Cossey opened it with eagerness. It
      contained an inclosure in Ida&rsquo;s writing, and this he read first. It
      ran as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Mr. Cossey,&mdash; &ldquo;I am told that you are now able to
      read letters, so I hasten to write to you. First of all, let me say how
      thankful I am that you are in a fair way to complete recovery from your
      dreadful accident. And now I must tell you what I fear will be almost as
      painful to you to read as it is for me to write, namely, that the
      engagement between us is at an end. To put the matter frankly, you will
      remember that I rightly or wrongly became engaged to you on a certain
      condition. That condition has not been fulfilled, for Mr. Quest, to whom
      the mortgages on my father&rsquo;s property have been transferred by you,
      is pressing for their payment. Consequently the obligation on my part is
      at an end, and with it the engagement must end also, for I grieve to tell
      you that it is not one which my personal inclination will induce me to
      carry out. Wishing you a speedy and complete recovery, and every happiness
      and prosperity in your future life, believe me, dear Mr. Cossey,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very truly yours, &ldquo;Ida de la Molle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He put down this uncompromising and crushing epistle and nervously glanced
      at the Squire&rsquo;s, which was very short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Cossey,&rdquo; it began,&mdash; &ldquo;Ida has shown me the
      inclosed letter. I think that you did unwisely when you entered into what
      must be called a money bargain for my daughter&rsquo;s hand. Whether under
      all the circumstances she does either well or wisely to repudiate the
      engagement after it has once been agreed upon, is not for me to judge. She
      is a free agent and has a natural right to dispose of her life as she
      thinks fit. This being so I have of course no option but to endorse her
      decision, so far as I have anything to do with the matter. It is a
      decision which I for some reasons regret, but which I am quite powerless
      to alter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me, with kind regards, &ldquo;Truly yours, &ldquo;James de
      la Molle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward Cossey turned his face to the wall and indulged in such meditations
      as the occasion gave rise to, and they were bitter enough. He was as bent
      upon this marriage as he had ever been, more so in fact, now that his
      father was out of the way. He knew that Ida disliked him, he had known
      that all along, but he had trusted to time and marriage to overcome the
      dislike. And now that accursed Quest had brought about the ruin of his
      hopes. Ida had seen her chance of escape, and, like a bold woman, had
      seized upon it. There was one ray of hope, and one only. He knew that the
      money would not be forthcoming to pay off the mortgages. He could see too
      from the tone of the Squire&rsquo;s letter that he did not altogether
      approve of his daughter&rsquo;s decision. And his father was dead. Like
      Caesar, he was the master of many legions, or rather of much money, which
      is as good as legions. Money can make most paths smooth to the feet of the
      traveller, and why not this? After much thought he came to a conclusion.
      He would not trust his chance to paper, he would plead his cause in
      person. So he wrote a short note to the Squire acknowledging Ida&rsquo;s
      and his letter, and saying that he hoped to come and see them as soon as
      ever the doctor would allow him out of doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile George, having delivered his letter, had gone upon another
      errand. Pulling up the fat pony in front of Mr. Quest&rsquo;s office he
      alighted and entered. Mr. Quest was disengaged, and he was shown straight
      into the inner office, where the lawyer sat, looking more refined and
      gentlemanlike than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, George?&rdquo; he said cheerily; &ldquo;sit down;
      what is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; answered that lugubrious worthy, as he awkwardly
      took a seat, &ldquo;the question is what isn&rsquo;t it? These be rum
      times, they be, they fare to puzzle a man, they du.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Quest, balancing a quill pen on his finger,
      &ldquo;the times are bad enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dash it all, sir,&rdquo; went on George presently, &ldquo;I may as
      well get it out; I hev come to speak to you about the Squire&rsquo;s
      business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Quest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; went on George, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m told that these
      dratted mortgages hev passed into your hands, and that you hev called in
      the money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is correct,&rdquo; said Mr. Quest again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, the fact is that the Squire can&rsquo;t git the money.
      It can&rsquo;t be had nohow. Nobody won&rsquo;t take the land as security.
      It might be so much water for all folk to look at it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so. Land is in very bad odour as security now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that being so, sir, what is to be done?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Quest shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;I do not know. If the money is
      not forthcoming, of course I shall, however unwillingly, be forced to take
      my legal remedy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning, sir&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning that I shall bring an action for foreclosure and do what I
      can with the lands.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      George&rsquo;s face darkened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that reads, sir, that the Squire and Miss Ida will be turned
      out of Honham, where they and theirs hev been for centuries, and that you
      will turn in?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is what it comes to, George. I am sincerely sorry to
      press the Squire, but it&rsquo;s a matter of thirty thousand pounds, and I
      am not in a position to throw away thirty thousand pounds.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said George, rising in indignation, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      rightly know how you came by them there mortgages. There is some things as
      laryers know and honest men don&rsquo;t know, and that&rsquo;s one on
      them. But it seems that you&rsquo;ve got &lsquo;em and are a-going to use
      &lsquo;em&mdash;and that being so, Mr. Quest, I have summut to say to you&mdash;and
      that is that no good won&rsquo;t come to you from this here move.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by that, George?&rdquo; said the lawyer sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Niver you mind what I mean, sir. I means what I says. I means that
      sometimes people has things in their lives snugged away where nobody can&rsquo;t
      see &lsquo;em, things as quiet as though they was dead and buried, and
      that ain&rsquo;t dead nor buried neither, things so much alive that they
      fare as though they were fit to kick the lid off their coffin. That&rsquo;s
      what I means, sir, and I means that when folk set to work to do a hard and
      wicked thing those dead things sometimes gits up and walks where they is
      least wanting; and mayhap if you goes on for to turn the old Squire and
      Miss Ida out of the Castle, mayhap, sir, summut of that sort will happen
      to you, for mark my word, sir, there&rsquo;s justice in the world, sir, as
      mebbe you will find out. And now, sir, begging your pardon, I&rsquo;ll
      wish you good-morning, and leave you to think on what I&rsquo;ve said,&rdquo;
      and he was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George!&rdquo; called Mr. Quest after him, rising from his chair,
      &ldquo;George!&rdquo; but George was out of hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now what did he mean by that&mdash;what the devil did he mean?&rdquo;
      said Mr. Quest with a gasp as he sat down again. &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; he
      thought, &ldquo;that man cannot have got hold of anything about Edith.
      Impossible, impossible; if he had he would have said more, he would not
      have confined himself to hinting, that would take a cleverer man, he would
      have shown his hand. He must have been speaking at random to frighten me,
      I suppose. By heaven! what a thing it would be if he <i>had</i> got hold
      of something. Ruin! absolute ruin! I&rsquo;ll settle up this business as
      soon as I can and leave the country; I can&rsquo;t stand the strain, it&rsquo;s
      like having a sword over one&rsquo;s head. I&rsquo;ve half a mind to leave
      it in somebody else&rsquo;s hands and go at once. No, for that would look
      like running away. It must be all rubbish; how could he know anything
      about it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So shaken was he, however, that though he tried once and yet again, he
      found it impossible to settle himself down to work till he had taken a
      couple of glasses of sherry from the decanter in the cupboard. Even as he
      did so he wondered if the shadow of the sword disturbed him so much, how
      he would be affected if it ever was his lot to face the glimmer of its
      naked blade.
    </p>
    <p>
      No further letter came to Edward Cossey from the Castle, but, impatient as
      he was to do so, another fortnight elapsed before he was able to see Ida
      and her father. At last one fine December morning for the first time since
      his accident he was allowed to take carriage exercise, and his first drive
      was to Honham Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Squire, who was sitting in the vestibule writing letters, saw a
      poor pallid man, rolled up in fur, with a white face scarred with shot
      marks and black rings round his large dark eyes, being helped from a
      closed carriage, he did not know who it was, and called to Ida, who was
      passing along the passage, to tell him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course she recognised her admirer instantly, and wished to leave the
      room, but her father prevented her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got into this mess,&rdquo; he said, forgetting how and for whom
      she got into it, &ldquo;and now you must get out of it in your own way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Edward, having been assisted into the room, saw Ida standing there,
      all the blood in his wasted body seemed to rush into his pallid face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Cossey?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am glad to see
      you out, and hope that you are better.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, I cannot hear you,&rdquo; he said, turning
      round; &ldquo;I am stone deaf in my right ear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A pang of pity shot through her heart. Edward Cossey, feeble, dejected,
      and limping from the jaws of Death, was a very different being to Edward
      Cossey in the full glow of his youth, health, and strength. Indeed, so
      much did his condition appeal to her sympathies that for the first time
      since her mental attitude towards him had been one of entire indifference,
      she looked on him without repugnance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile her father had shaken him by the hand, and led him to an
      armchair before the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then after a few questions and answers as to his accident and merciful
      recovery there came a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he broke it. &ldquo;I have come to see you both,&rdquo; he said
      with a faint nervous smile, &ldquo;about the letters you wrote me. If my
      condition had allowed I should have come before, but it would not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Squire attentively, while Ida folded her hands
      in her lap and sat still with her eyes fixed upon the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that the old proverb has
      applied to my case as to so many others&mdash;being absent I have
      suffered. I understand from these letters that my engagement to you, Miss
      de la Molle, is broken off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a motion of assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that it is broken off on the ground that having been forced by
      a combination of circumstances which I cannot enter into to transfer the
      mortgages to Mr. Quest, consequently I broke my bargain with you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ida.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well then, I come to tell you both that I am ready to find the
      money to meet those mortgages and to pay them off in full.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the Squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Also that I am ready to do what I offered to do before, and which,
      as my father is now dead, I am perfectly in a position to do, namely, to
      settle two hundred thousand pounds absolutely upon Ida, and indeed
      generally to do anything else that she or you may wish,&rdquo; and he
      looked at the Squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no use looking to me for an answer,&rdquo; said he with some
      irritation. &ldquo;I have no voice in the matter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to Ida, who put her hand before her face and shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Edward, somewhat bitterly, &ldquo;I should not
      be far wrong if I said that Colonel Quaritch has more to do with your
      change of mind than the fact of the transfer of these mortgages.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She dropped her hand and looked him full in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite right, Mr. Cossey,&rdquo; she said boldly. &ldquo;Colonel
      Quaritch and I are attached to each other, and we hope one day to be
      married.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound that Quaritch,&rdquo; growled the Squire beneath his
      breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward winced visibly at this outspoken statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ida,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I make one last appeal to you. I am
      devoted to you with all my heart; so devoted that though it may seem
      foolish to say so, especially before your father, I really think I would
      rather not have recovered from my accident than that I should have
      recovered for this. I will give you everything that a woman can want, and
      my money will make your family what it was centuries ago, the greatest in
      the country side. I don&rsquo;t pretend to have been a saint&mdash;perhaps
      you may have heard something against me in that way&mdash;or to be
      anything out of the common. I am only an ordinary every-day man, but I am
      devoted to you. Think, then, before you refuse me altogether.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have thought, Mr. Cossey,&rdquo; answered Ida almost
      passionately: &ldquo;I have thought until I am tired of thinking, and I do
      not consider it fair that you should press me like this, especially before
      my father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he said, rising with difficulty, &ldquo;I have said
      all I have to say, and done all that I can do. I shall still hope that you
      may change your mind. I shall not yet abandon hope. Good-bye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She touched his hand, and then the Squire offering him his arm, he went
      down the steps to his carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, Mr. de la Molle,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that bad as things
      look for me, if they should take a turn I shall have your support.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; answered the Squire, &ldquo;I tell you frankly
      that I wish my daughter would marry you. As I said before, it would for
      obvious reasons be desirable. But Ida is not like ordinary women. When she
      sets her mind upon a thing she sets it like a flint. Times may change,
      however, and that is all I can say. Yes, if I were you, I should remember
      that this is a changeable world, and women are the most changeable things
      in it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When the carriage was gone he re-entered the vestibule. Ida, who was going
      away much disturbed in mind, saw him come, and knew from the expression of
      his face that there would be trouble. With characteristic courage she
      turned, determined to brave it out.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII. &mdash; THE SQUIRE SPEAKS HIS MIND
    </h2>
    <p>
      For a minute or more her father fidgeted about, moving his papers
      backwards and forwards but saying nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he spoke. &ldquo;You have taken a most serious and painful step,
      Ida,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Of course you have a right to do as you
      please, you are of full age, and I cannot expect that you will consider me
      or your family in your matrimonial engagements, but at the same time I
      think it is my duty to point out to you what it is that you are doing. You
      are refusing one of the finest matches in England in order to marry a
      broken-down, middle-aged, half-pay colonel, a man who can hardly support
      you, whose part in life is played, or who is apparently too idle to seek
      another.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Ida&rsquo;s eyes flashed ominously, but she made no comment, being
      apparently afraid to trust herself to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are doing this,&rdquo; went on her father, working himself up
      as he spoke, &ldquo;in the face of my wishes, and with a knowledge that
      your action will bring your family, to say nothing of your father, to
      utter and irretrievable ruin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, father, surely,&rdquo; broke in Ida, almost in a cry,
      &ldquo;you would not have me marry one man when I love another. When I
      made the promise I had not become attached to Colonel Quaritch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love! pshaw!&rdquo; said her father. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me
      in that sentimental and school-girl way&mdash;you are too old for it. I am
      a plain man, and I believe in family affection and in <i>duty</i>, Ida. <i>Love</i>,
      as you call it, is only too often another word for self-will and
      selfishness and other things that we are better without.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can understand, father,&rdquo; answered Ida, struggling to keep
      her temper under this jobation, &ldquo;that my refusal to marry Mr. Cossey
      is disagreeable to you for obvious reasons, though it is not so very long
      since you detested him yourself. But I do not see why an honest woman&rsquo;s
      affection for another man should be talked of as though there was
      something shameful about it. It is all very well to sneer at &lsquo;love,&rsquo;
      but, after all a woman is flesh and blood; she is not a chattel or a slave
      girl, and marriage is not like anything else&mdash;it means many things to
      a woman. There is no magic about marriage to make that which is
      unrighteous righteous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said her father, &ldquo;it is no good your lecturing
      to me on marriage, Ida. If you do not want to marry Cossey, I can&rsquo;t
      force you to. If you want to ruin me, your family and yourself, you must
      do so. But there is one thing. While it is over me, which I suppose will
      not be for much longer, my house is my own, and I will not have that
      Colonel of yours hanging about it, and I shall write to him to say so. You
      are your own mistress, and if you choose to walk over to church and marry
      him you can do so, but it will be done without my consent, which of
      course, however, is an unnecessary formality. Do you hear me, Ida?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have quite done, father,&rdquo; she answered coldly, &ldquo;I
      should like to go before I say something which I might be sorry for. Of
      course you can write what you like to Colonel Quaritch, and I shall write
      to him, too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father made no answer beyond sitting down at his table and grabbing
      viciously at a pen. So she left the room, indignant, indeed, but with as
      heavy a heart as any woman could carry in her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Sir,&rdquo; wrote the not unnaturally indignant Squire,
      &ldquo;I have been informed by my daughter Ida of her entanglement with
      you. It is one which, for reasons that I need not enter into, is
      distasteful to me, as well as, I am sorry to say, ruinous to Ida herself
      and to her family. Ida is of full age, and must, of course, do as she
      pleases with herself. But I cannot consent to become a party to what I
      disapprove of so strongly, and this being the case, I must beg you to
      cease your visits to my house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, sir, your obedient servant, &ldquo;James de la Molle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel Quaritch, V.C.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida as soon as she had sufficiently recovered herself also wrote to the
      Colonel. She told him the whole story, keeping nothing back, and ended her
      letter thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, dear Harold, was a woman in a greater difficulty and never
      have I more needed help and advice. You know and have good reason to know
      how hateful this marriage would be to me, loving you as I do entirely and
      alone, and having no higher desire than to become your wife. But of course
      I see the painfulness of the position. I am not so selfish as my father
      believes or says that he believes. I quite understand how great would be
      the material advantage to my father if I could bring myself to marry Mr.
      Cossey. You may remember I told you once that I thought no woman has a
      right to prefer her own happiness to the prosperity of her whole family.
      But, Harold, it is easy to speak thus, and very, very hard to act up to
      it. What am I to do? What am I to do? And yet how can I in common fairness
      ask you to answer that question? God help us both, Harold! Is there <i>no</i>
      way out of it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These letters were both duly received by Harold Quaritch on the following
      morning and threw him into a fever of anxiety and doubt. He was a just and
      reasonable man, and, knowing something of human nature, under the
      circumstances did not altogether wonder at the Squire&rsquo;s violence and
      irritation. The financial position of the de la Molle family was little,
      if anything, short of desperate. He could easily understand how maddening
      it must be to a man like Mr. de la Molle, who loved Honham, which had for
      centuries been the home of his race, better than he loved anything on
      earth, to suddenly realise that it must pass away from him and his for
      ever, merely because a woman happened to prefer one man to another, and
      that man, to his view, the less eligible of the two. So keenly did he
      realise this, indeed, that he greatly doubted whether or no he was
      justified in continuing his advances to Ida. Finally, after much thought,
      he wrote to the Squire as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have received your letter, and also one from Ida, and I hope you
      will believe me when I say that I quite understand and sympathise with the
      motives which evidently led you to write it. I am unfortunately&mdash;although
      I never regretted it till now&mdash;a poor man, whereas my rival suitor is
      a rich one. I shall, of course, strictly obey your injunctions; and,
      moreover, I can assure you that, whatever my own feelings may be in the
      matter, I shall do nothing, either directly or indirectly, to influence
      Ida&rsquo;s ultimate decision. She must decide for herself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To Ida herself he also wrote at length:

      &ldquo;Dearest Ida,&rdquo; he ended, &ldquo;I can say nothing more; you
      must judge for yourself; and I shall accept your decision loyally whatever
      it may be. It is unnecessary for me to tell you how inextricably my
      happiness in life is interwoven with that decision, but at the same time I
      do not wish to influence it. It certainly to my mind does not seem right
      that a woman should be driven into sacrificing her whole life to secure
      any monetary advantage either for herself or for others, but then the
      world is full of things that are not right. I can give you no advice, for
      I do not know what advice I ought to give. I try to put myself out of the
      question and to consider you, and you only; but even then I fear that my
      judgment is not impartial. At any rate, the less we see of each other at
      present the better, for I do not wish to appear to be taking any undue
      advantage. If we are destined to pass our lives together, this temporary
      estrangement will not matter, and if on the other hand we are doomed to a
      life-long separation the sooner we begin the better. It is a hard world,
      and sometimes (as it does now) my heart sinks within me as from year to
      year I struggle on towards a happiness that ever vanishes when I stretch
      out my hand to clasp it; but, if I feel thus, what must you feel who have
      so much more to bear? My dearest love, what can I say? I can only say with
      you, God help us!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter did not tend to raise Ida&rsquo;s spirits. Evidently her lover
      saw that there was another side to the question&mdash;the side of duty,
      and was too honest to hide it from her. She had said that she would have
      nothing to do with Edward Cossey, but she was well aware that the matter
      was still an open one. What should she do, what ought she to do? Abandon
      her love, desecrate herself and save her father and her house, or cling to
      her love and leave the rest to chance? It was a cruel position, nor did
      the lapse of time tend to make it less cruel. Her father went about the
      place pale and melancholy&mdash;all his jovial manner had vanished beneath
      the pressure of impending ruin. He treated her with studious and
      old-fashioned courtesy, but she could see that he was bitterly aggrieved
      by her conduct and that the anxiety of his position was telling on his
      health. If this was the case now, what, she wondered, would happen in the
      Spring, when steps were actually taken to sell the place?
    </p>
    <p>
      One bright cold morning she was walking with her father through the fields
      down on the foot-path that led to the church, and it would have been hard
      to say which of the two looked the paler or the more miserable. On the
      previous day the Squire had seen Mr. Quest and made as much of an appeal
      <i>ad misericordiam</i> to him as his pride would allow, only to find the
      lawyer very courteous, very regretful, but hard as adamant. Also that very
      morning a letter had reached him from London announcing that the last hope
      of raising money to meet the mortgages had failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The path ran along towards the road past a line of oaks. Half-way down
      this line they came across George, who, with his marking instrument in his
      hand, was contemplating some of the trees which it was proposed to take
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing there?&rdquo; said the Squire, in a melancholy
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marking, Squire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you may as well save yourself the trouble, for the place will
      belong to somebody else before the sap is up in those oaks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Squire, don&rsquo;t you begin to talk like that, for I don&rsquo;t
      believe it. That ain&rsquo;t a-going to happen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t a-going to happen, you stupid fellow, ain&rsquo;t
      a-going to happen,&rdquo; answered the Squire with a dreary laugh. &ldquo;Why,
      look there,&rdquo; and he pointed to a dog-cart which had drawn up on the
      road in such a position that they could see it without its occupants
      seeing them; &ldquo;they are taking notes already.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      George looked and so did Ida. Mr. Quest was the driver of the dog-cart,
      which he had pulled up in such a position as to command a view of the
      Castle, and his companion&mdash;in whom George recognised a well-known
      London auctioneer who sometimes did business in these parts&mdash;was
      standing up, an open notebook in his hand, alternately looking at the
      noble towers of the gateway and jotting down memoranda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn &lsquo;em, and so they be,&rdquo; said George, utterly
      forgetting his manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida looked up and saw her father&rsquo;s eyes fixed firmly upon her with
      an expression that seemed to say, &ldquo;See, you wilful woman, see the
      ruin that you have brought upon us!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned away; she could not bear it, and that very night she came to a
      determination, which in due course was communicated to Harold, and him
      alone. That determination was to let things be for the present, upon the
      chance of something happening by means of which the dilemma might be
      solved. But if nothing happened&mdash;and indeed it did not seem probable
      to her that anything would happen&mdash;then she would sacrifice herself
      at the last moment. She believed, indeed she knew, that she could always
      call Edward Cossey back to her if she liked. It was a compromise, and like
      all compromises had an element of weakness; but it gave time, and time to
      her was like breath to the dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said George presently, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Boisingham
      Quarter Sessions the day after to-morrow, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; (Mr. de
      la Molle was chairman of Quarter Sessions.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course, it is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      George thought for a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a-thinking, Squire, that if I arn&rsquo;t wanting that
      day I want to go up to Lunnon about a bit of business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go up to London!&rdquo; said the Squire; &ldquo;why what are you
      going to do there? You were in London the other day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Squire,&rdquo; he answered, looking inexpressibly sly,
      &ldquo;that ain&rsquo;t no matter of nobody&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s a bit of
      private affairs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; said the Squire, his interest dying out.
      &ldquo;You are always full of twopenny-halfpenny mysteries,&rdquo; and he
      continued his walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      But George shook his fist in the direction of the road down which the
      dog-cart had driven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you laryer devil,&rdquo; he said, alluding to Mr. Quest.
      &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t make Boisingham, yes, and all England, too hot to
      hold you, my mother never christened me and my name ain&rsquo;t George. I&rsquo;ll
      give you what for, my cuckoo, that I will!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIV. &mdash; GEORGE&rsquo;S DIPLOMATIC ERRAND
    </h2>
    <p>
      George carried out his intention of going to London. On the second morning
      after the day when Mr. Quest had driven the auctioneer in the dog-cart to
      Honham, he might have been seen an hour before it was light purchasing a
      third class return ticket to Liverpool Street. Arriving there in safety he
      partook of a second breakfast, for it was ten o&rsquo;clock, and then
      hiring a cab caused himself to be driven to the end of that street in
      Pimlico where he had gone with the fair &ldquo;Edithia&rdquo; and where
      Johnnie had made acquaintance with his ash stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dismissing the cab he made his way to the house with the red pillars, but
      on arriving was considerably taken aback, for the place had every
      appearance of being deserted. There were no blinds to the windows, and on
      the steps were muddy footmarks and bits of rag and straw which seemed to
      be the litter of a recent removal. Indeed, there on the road were the
      broad wheelmarks of the van which had carted off the furniture. He stared
      at this sight in dismay. The bird had apparently flown, leaving no
      address, and he had taken his trip for nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pressed upon the electric bell; that is, he did this ultimately. George
      was not accustomed to electric bells, indeed he had never seen one before,
      and after attempting in vain to pull it with his fingers (for he knew that
      it must be a bell because there was the word itself written on it), as a
      last resource he condescended to try his teeth. Ultimately, however, he
      discovered how to use it, but without result. Either the battery had been
      taken away, or it was out of gear. Just as he was wondering what to do
      next he made a discovery&mdash;the door was slightly ajar. He pushed it
      and it opened&mdash;revealing a dirty hall, stripped of every scrap of
      furniture. Entering, he shut the door and walked up the stairs to the room
      whence he had fled after thrashing Johnnie. Here he paused and listened,
      thinking that he heard somebody in the room. Nor was he mistaken, for
      presently a well-remembered voice shrilled out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s skulking round outside there? If it&rsquo;s one of
      those bailiffs he&rsquo;d better hook it, for there&rsquo;s nothing left
      here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      George&rsquo;s countenance positively beamed at the sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bailiffs, marm?&rdquo; he called through the door&mdash;&ldquo;it
      ain&rsquo;t no varminty bailiffs, it&rsquo;s a friend, and just when you&rsquo;re
      a-wanting one seemingly. Can I come in?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, come in, whoever you are,&rdquo; said the voice.
      Accordingly he opened the door and entered, and this was what he saw. The
      room, like the rest of the house, had been stripped of everything, with
      the solitary exceptions of a box and a mattress, beside which were an
      empty bottle and a dirty glass. On the mattress sat the fair Edithia, <i>alias</i>
      Mrs. d&rsquo;Aubigne, <i>alias</i> the Tiger, <i>alias</i> Mrs. Quest, and
      such a sight as she presented George had never seen before. Her fierce
      face bore traces of recent heavy drinking and was moreover dirty, haggard
      and dreadful to look upon; her hair was a frowsy mat, on some patches of
      which the golden dye had faded, leaving it its natural hue of doubtful
      grey. She wore no collar and her linen was open at the neck. On her feet
      were a filthy pair of white satin slippers, and on her back that same
      gorgeous pink satin tea-gown which Mr. Quest had observed on the occasion
      of his visit, now however soiled and torn. Anything more squalid or
      repulsive than the whole picture cannot be imagined, and though his nerves
      were pretty strong, and in the course of his life he had seen many a sight
      of utter destitution, George literally recoiled from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; said the hag sharply, &ldquo;and
      who the dickens are you? Ah, I know now; you&rsquo;re the chap who whacked
      Johnnie,&rdquo; and she burst into a hoarse scream of laughter at the
      recollection. &ldquo;It was mean of you though to hook it and leave me. He
      pulled me, and I was fined two pounds by the beak.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mean of <i>him</i>, marm, not me, but he was a mean varmint
      altogether he was; to go and pull a lady too, I niver heard of such a
      thing. But, marm, if I might say so, you seem to be in trouble here,&rdquo;
      and he took a seat upon the deal box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In trouble, I should think I was in trouble. There&rsquo;s been an
      execution in the house, that is, there&rsquo;s been three executions, one
      for rates and taxes, one for a butcher&rsquo;s bill, and one for rent.
      They all came together, and fought like wild cats for the things. That was
      yesterday, and you see all they have left me; cleaned out everything down
      to my new yellow satin, and then asked for more. They wanted to know where
      my jewellery was, but I did them, hee, hee!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning, marm?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning that I hid it, that is, what was left of it, under a board.
      But that ain&rsquo;t the worst. When I was asleep that devil Ellen, who&rsquo;s
      had her share all these years, got to the board and collared the things
      and bolted with them, and look what she&rsquo;s left me instead,&rdquo;
      and she held up a scrap of paper, &ldquo;a receipt for five years&rsquo;
      wages, and she&rsquo;s had them over and over again. Ah, if ever I get a
      chance at her,&rdquo; and she doubled her long hand and made a motion as
      of a person scratching. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s bolted and left me here to
      starve. I haven&rsquo;t had a bit since yesterday, nor a drink either, and
      that&rsquo;s worse. What&rsquo;s to become of me? I&rsquo;m starving. I
      shall have to go to the workhouse. Yes, me,&rdquo; she added in a scream,
      &ldquo;me, who have spent thousands; I shall have to go to a workhouse
      like a common woman!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cruel, marm, cruel,&rdquo; said the sympathetic George,
      &ldquo;and you a lawful wedded wife &lsquo;till death do us part.&rsquo;
      But, marm, I saw a public over the way. Now, no offence, but you&rsquo;ll
      let me just go over and fetch a bite and a sup.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she answered hungrily, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a gent, you
      are, though you&rsquo;re a country one. You go, while I just make a little
      toilette, and as for the drink, why let it be brandy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brandy it shall be,&rdquo; said the gallant George, and departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In ten minutes he returned with a supply of beef patties, and a bottle of
      good, strong &ldquo;British Brown,&rdquo; which as everybody knows is a
      sufficient quantity to render three privates or two blue-jackets drunk and
      incapable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman, who now presented a slightly more respectable appearance,
      seized the bottle, and pouring about a wine-glass and a half of its
      contents into a tumbler mixed it with an equal quantity of water and drank
      it off at a draught.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and now for a patty.
      It&rsquo;s a real picnic, this is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He handed her one, but she could not eat more than half of it, for alcohol
      destroys the healthier appetites, and she soon went back to the brandy
      bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, marm, that you are a little more comfortable, perhaps you will
      tell me how as you got into this way, and you with a rich husband, as I
      well knows, to love and cherish you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A husband to love and cherish me?&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;why, I
      have written to him three times to tell him that I&rsquo;m starving, and
      never a cent has he given me&mdash;and there&rsquo;s no allowance due yet,
      and when there is they&rsquo;ll take it, for I owe hundreds.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;I call it cruel&mdash;cruel, and
      he rolling in gold. Thirty thousand pounds he hev just made, that I knows
      on. You must be an angel, marm, to stand it, an angel without wings. If it
      were my husband, now I&rsquo;d know the reason why.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but I daren&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;d murder me. He said he would.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      George laughed gently. &ldquo;Lord! Lord!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to see
      how men play it off upon poor weak women, working on their narves and that
      like. He kill you! Laryer Quest kill you, and he the biggest coward in
      Boisingham; but there it is. This is a world of wrong, as the parson says,
      and the poor shorn lambs must jamb their tails down and turn their backs
      to the wind, and so must you, marm. So it&rsquo;s the workhus you&rsquo;ll
      be in to-morrow. Well, you&rsquo;ll find it a poor place; the skilly is
      that rough it do fare to take the skin off your throat, and not a drop of
      liquor, not even of a cup of hot tea, and work too, lots of it &mdash;scrubbing,
      marm, scrubbing!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This vivid picture of miseries to come drew something between a sob and a
      howl from the woman. There is nothing more horrible to the imagination of
      such people than the idea of being forced to work. If their notions of a
      future state of punishment could be got at, they would be found in nine
      cases out of ten to resolve themselves into a vague conception of hard
      labour in a hot climate. It was the idea of the scrubbing that
      particularly affected the Tiger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to
      chokey first&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, marm,&rdquo; said George, in a persuasive voice, and
      pushing the brandy bottle towards her, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s the need for
      you to go to the workhus or to chokey either&mdash;you with a rich husband
      as is bound by law to support you as becomes a lady? And, marm, mind
      another thing, a husband as hev wickedly deserted you&mdash;which how he
      could do so it ain&rsquo;t for me to say&mdash;and is living along of
      another young party.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She took some more brandy before she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very well, you duffer,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but
      how am I to get at him? I tell you I&rsquo;m afraid of him, and even if I
      weren&rsquo;t, I haven&rsquo;t a cent to travel with, and if I got there
      what am I to do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for being afeard, marm,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      told you Laryer Quest is a long sight more frightened of you than you are
      of him. Then as for money, why, marm, I&rsquo;m a-going down to Boisingham
      myself by the train as leaves Liverpool Street at half-past one, and that&rsquo;s
      an hour and a bit from now, and it&rsquo;s proud and pleased I should be
      to take a lady down and be the means of bringing them as has been in holy
      matrimony togither again. And as to what you should do when you gets
      there, why, you should just walk up with your marriage lines and say,
      &lsquo;You are my lawful husband, and I calls on you to cease living as
      you didn&rsquo;t oughter and to take me back;&rsquo; and if he don&rsquo;t,
      why then you swears an information, and it&rsquo;s a case of warrant for
      bigamy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman chuckled, and then suddenly seized with suspicion looked at her
      visitor sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want me to blow the gaff for?&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
      a leery old hand, you are, for all your simple ways, and you&rsquo;ve got
      some game on, I&rsquo;ll take my davy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I a game&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo; answered George, an
      expression of the deepest pain spreading itself over his ugly features.
      &ldquo;No, marm&mdash;and when one hev wanted to help a friend too. Well,
      if you think that&mdash;and no doubt misfortune hev made you doubtful-like&mdash;the
      best I can do is to bid you good-day, and to wish you well out of your
      troubles, workhus and all, marm, which I do according,&rdquo; and he rose
      from his box with much dignity, politely bowed to the hag on the mattress,
      and then turning walked towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sprung up with an oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the change
      out of him; I&rsquo;ll teach him to let his lawful wife starve on a
      beggarly pittance. I don&rsquo;t care if he does try to kill me. I&rsquo;ll
      ruin him,&rdquo; and she stamped upon the floor and screamed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      ruin him, I&rsquo;ll ruin him!&rdquo; presenting such a picture of
      abandoned rage and wickedness that even George, whose feelings were not
      finely strung, inwardly shrank from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, marm,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;no wonder you&rsquo;re put about.
      When I think of what you&rsquo;ve had to suffer, I own it makes my blood
      go a-biling through my veins. But if you is a-coming, mayhap it would be
      as well to stop cursing of and put your hat on, and we hev got to catch
      the train.&rdquo; And he pointed to a head-gear chiefly made of somewhat
      dilapidated peacock feathers, and an ulster which the bailiffs had either
      overlooked or left through pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put on the hat and cloak. Then going to the hole beneath the board,
      out of which she said the woman Ellen had stolen her jewellery, she
      extracted the copy of the certificate of marriage which that lady had not
      apparently thought worth taking, and placed it in the pocket of her pink
      silk <i>peignoir</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then George having first secured the remainder of the bottle of brandy,
      which he slipped into his capacious pocket, they started, and drove to
      Liverpool Street. Such a spectacle as the Tiger upon the platform George
      was wont in after days to declare he never did see. But it can easily be
      imagined that a fierce, dissolute, hungry-looking woman, with half-dyed
      hair, who had drunk as much as was good for her, dressed in a hat made of
      shabby peacock feathers, dirty white shoes, an ulster with some buttons
      off, and a gorgeous but filthy pink silk tea-gown, presented a
      sufficiently curious appearance. Nor did it lose strength by contrast with
      that of her companion, the sober and melancholy-looking George, who was
      arrayed in his pepper-and-salt Sunday suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      So curious indeed was their aspect that the people loitering about the
      platform collected round them, and George, who felt heartily ashamed of
      the position, was thankful enough when once the train started. From
      motives of economy he had taken her a third-class ticket, and at this she
      grumbled, saying that she was accustomed to travel, like a lady should,
      first; but he appeased her with the brandy bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the journey through he talked to her about her wrongs, till at last,
      what between the liquor and his artful incitements, she was inflamed into
      a condition of savage fury against Mr. Quest. When once she got to this
      point he would let her have no more brandy, seeing that she was now ripe
      for his purpose, which was of course to use her to ruin the man who would
      ruin the house he served.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Quest, sitting in state as Clerk to the Magistrates assembled in
      Quarter Sessions at the Court House, Boisingham, little guessed that the
      sword at whose shadow he had trembled all these years was even now falling
      on his head. Still less did he dream that the hand to cut the thread which
      held it was that of the stupid bumpkin whose warning he had despised.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV. &mdash; THE SWORD OF DAMOCLES
    </h2>
    <p>
      At last the weary journey was over, and to George&rsquo;s intense relief
      he found himself upon the platform at Boisingham. He was a pretty tough
      subject, but he felt that a very little more of the company of the fair
      Edithia would be too much for him. As it happened, the station-master was
      a particular friend of his, and the astonishment of that worthy when he
      saw the respectable George in such company could scarcely be expressed in
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why boar! Well I never! Is she a furriner?&rdquo; he ejaculated in
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you mean me,&rdquo; said Edithia, who was by now in fine
      bellicose condition, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no more foreign than you are. Shut
      up, can&rsquo;t you? or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and she took a step towards
      the stout station-master. He retreated precipitately, caught his heel
      against the threshold of the booking office and vanished backwards with a
      crash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady, marm, steady,&rdquo; said George. &ldquo;Save it up now,
      do, and as for you, don&rsquo;t you irritate her none of yer, or I won&rsquo;t
      answer for the consequences, for she&rsquo;s an injured woman she is, and
      injured women is apt to be dangerous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It chanced that a fly which had brought somebody to the station was still
      standing there. George bundled his fair charge into it, telling the driver
      to go to the Sessions House.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, marm,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;listen to me; I&rsquo;m a-going
      to take you to the man as hev wronged you. He&rsquo;s sitting as clerk to
      the magistrates. Do you go up and call him your husband. Thin he&rsquo;ll
      tell the policeman to take you away. Thin do you sing out for justice,
      because when people sings out for justice everybody&rsquo;s bound to
      hearken, and say how as you wants a warrant agin him for bigamy, and show
      them the marriage lines. Don&rsquo;t you be put down, and don&rsquo;t you
      spare him. If you don&rsquo;t startle him you&rsquo;ll niver get northing
      out of him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spare him,&rdquo; she snarled; &ldquo;not I. I&rsquo;ll have his
      blood. But look here, if he&rsquo;s put in chokey, where&rsquo;s the tin
      to come from?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, marm,&rdquo; answered George with splendid mendacity, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
      the best thing that can happen for you, for if they collar him you git the
      property, and that&rsquo;s law.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;if I&rsquo;d known that he&rsquo;d
      have been collared long ago, I can tell you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said George, seeing that they were nearing their
      destination. &ldquo;Hev one more nip just to keep your spirits up,&rdquo;
      and he produced the brandy bottle, at which she took a long pull.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;go for him like a wild cat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never you fear,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They got out of the cab and entered the Sessions House without attracting
      any particular notice. The court itself was crowded, for a case which had
      excited public interest was coming to a conclusion. The jury had given
      their verdict, and sentence was being pronounced by Mr. de la Molle, the
      chairman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Quest was sitting at his table below the bench taking some notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s your husband,&rdquo; George whispered, &ldquo;now do
      you draw on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      George&rsquo;s part in the drama was played, and with a sigh of relief he
      fell back to watch its final development. He saw the fierce tall woman
      slip through the crowd like a snake or a panther to its prey, and some
      compunction touched him when he thought of the prey. He glanced at the
      elderly respectable-looking gentleman by the table, and reflected that he
      too was stalking <i>his</i> prey&mdash;the old Squire and the ancient
      house of de la Molle. Then his compunction vanished, and he rejoiced to
      think that he would be the means of destroying a man who, to fill his
      pockets, did not hesitate to ruin the family with which his life and the
      lives of his forefathers had been interwoven for many generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the woman had fought her way through the press, bursting the
      remaining buttons off her ulster in so doing, and reached the bar which
      separated spectators from the space reserved for the officials. On the
      further side of the bar was a gangway, and beyond it a table at which Mr.
      Quest sat. He had been busy writing something all this time, now he rose,
      passed it to Mr. de la Molle, and then turned to sit down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile his wife had craned her long lithe body forward over the bar
      till her head was almost level with the hither edge of the table. There
      she stood glaring at him, her wicked face alive with fury and malice, for
      the brandy she had drunk had caused her to forget her fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Quest turned, his eye caught the flash of colour from the peacock
      feather hat. Thence it travelled to the face beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a gasp, and the court seemed to whirl round him. The sword had
      fallen indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Billy!&rdquo; whispered the hateful voice, &ldquo;you see I&rsquo;ve
      come to look you up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a desperate effort he recovered himself. A policeman was standing
      near. He beckoned to him, and told him to remove the woman, who was drunk.
      The policeman advanced and touched her on the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, you be off,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re drunk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Mr. de la Molle ceased giving judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t drunk,&rdquo; said the woman, loud enough to attract
      the attention of the whole court, which now for the first time observed
      her extraordinary attire, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve a right to be in the
      public court.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said the policeman, &ldquo;the clerk says you&rsquo;re
      to go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The clerk says so, does he?&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;and do you
      know who the clerk is? I&rsquo;ll tell you all,&rdquo; and she raised her
      voice to a scream; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s my husband, my lawful wedded husband,
      and here&rsquo;s proof of it,&rdquo; and she took the folded certificate
      from her pocket and flung it so that it struck the desk of one of the
      magistrates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Quest sank into his chair, and a silence of astonishment fell upon the
      court.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire was the first to recover himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence,&rdquo; he said, addressing her. &ldquo;Silence. This
      cannot go on here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I want justice,&rdquo; she shrieked. &ldquo;I want justice; I
      want a warrant against that man for <i>bigamy</i>.&rdquo; (Sensation.)
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s left me to starve; me, his lawful wife. Look here,&rdquo;
      and she tore open the pink satin tea-gown, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t enough
      clothes on me; the bailiffs took all my clothes; I have suffered his
      cruelty for years, and borne it, and I can bear it no longer. Justice,
      your worships; I only ask for justice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be silent, woman,&rdquo; said Mr. de la Molle; &ldquo;if you have a
      criminal charge to bring against anybody there is a proper way to make it.
      Be silent or leave this court.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But she only screamed the more for <i>justice</i>, and loudly detailed
      fragments of her woes to the eagerly listening crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then policemen were ordered to remove her, and there followed a frightful
      scene. She shrieked and fought in such a fashion that it took four men to
      drag her to the door of the court, where she dropped exhausted against the
      wall in the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the observant George to himself, &ldquo;she hev
      done the trick proper, and no mistake. Couldn&rsquo;t have been better.
      That&rsquo;s a master one, that is.&rdquo; Then he turned his attention to
      the stricken man before him. Mr. Quest was sitting there, his face ashen,
      his eyes wide open, and his hands placed flat on the table before him.
      When silence had been restored he rose and turned to the bench apparently
      with the intention of addressing the court. But he said nothing, either
      because he could not find the words or because his courage failed him.
      There was a moment&rsquo;s intense silence, for every one in the crowded
      court was watching him, and the sense of it seemed to take what resolution
      he had left out of him. At any rate, he left the table and hurried from
      the court. In the passage he found the Tiger, who, surrounded by a little
      crowd, her hat awry and her clothes half torn from her back, was huddled
      gasping against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw him and began to speak, but he stopped and faced her. He faced
      her, grinding his teeth, and with such an awful fire of fury in his eyes
      that she shrank from him in terror, flattening herself against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; he said in a choked voice, and then
      passed on. A few paces down the passage he met one of his own clerks, a
      sharp fellow enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Jones,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you see that woman there. She
      has made a charge against me. Watch her. See where she goes to, and find
      out what she is going to do. Then come and tell me at the office. If you
      lose sight of her, you lose your place too. Do you understand?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the astonished clerk, and Mr. Quest was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made his way direct to the office. It was closed, for he had told his
      clerks he should not come back after court, and that they could go at
      half-past four. He had his key, however, and, entering, lit the gas. Then
      he went to his safe and sorted some papers, burning a good number of them.
      Two large documents, however, he put by his side to read. One was his
      will, the other was endorsed &ldquo;Statement of the circumstances
      connected with Edith.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      First he looked through his will. It had been made some years ago, and was
      entirely in favour of his wife, or, rather, of his reputed wife, Belle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may as well stand,&rdquo; he said aloud; &ldquo;if anything
      happens to me she&rsquo;ll take about ten thousand under it, and that was
      what she brought me.&rdquo; Taking the pen he went through the document
      carefully, and wherever the name of &ldquo;Belle Quest&rdquo; occurred he
      put a X, and inserted these words, &ldquo;Gennett, commonly known as Belle
      Quest,&rdquo; Gennett being Belle&rsquo;s maiden name, and initialled the
      correction. Next he glanced at the Statement. It contained a full and fair
      account of his connection with the woman who had ruined his life. &ldquo;I
      may as well leave it,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;some day it will show
      Belle that I was not quite so bad as I seemed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He replaced the statement in a brief envelope, sealed and directed it to
      Belle, and finally marked it, &ldquo;Not to be opened till my death.&mdash;W.
      Quest.&rdquo; Then he put the envelope away in the safe and took up the
      will for the same purpose. Next it on the table lay the deeds executed by
      Edward Cossey transferring the Honham mortgages to Mr. Quest in
      consideration of his abstaining from the commencement of a suit for
      divorce in which he proposed to join Edward Cossey as co-respondent.
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he thought to himself, &ldquo;that game is up. Belle is
      not my legal wife, therefore I cannot commence a suit against her in which
      Cossey would figure as co-respondent, and so the consideration fails. I am
      sorry, for I should have liked him to lose his thirty thousand pounds as
      well as his wife, but it can&rsquo;t be helped. It was a game of bluff,
      and now that the bladder has been pricked I haven&rsquo;t a leg to stand
      on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, taking a pen, he wrote on a sheet of paper which he inserted in the
      will, &ldquo;Dear B.,&mdash;You must return the Honham mortgages to Mr.
      Edward Cossey. As you are not my legal wife the consideration upon which
      he transferred them fails, and you cannot hold them in equity, nor I
      suppose would you wish to do so.&mdash;W. Q.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Having put all the papers away, he shut the safe at the moment that the
      clerk whom he had deputed to watch his wife knocked at the door and
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, I watched the woman. She stopped in the passage for a
      minute, and then George, Squire de la Molle&rsquo;s man, came out and
      spoke to her. I got quite close so as to hear, and he said, &lsquo;You&rsquo;d
      better get out of this.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Where to?&rsquo; she answered. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Back to London,&rsquo; he said, and gave her a sovereign,
      and she got up without a word and slunk off to the station followed by a
      mob of people. She is in the refreshment room now, but George sent word to
      say that they ought not to serve her with any drink.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time does the next train go&mdash;7.15, does it not?&rdquo;
      said Mr. Quest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go back to the station and keep an eye upon that woman, and
      when the time comes get me a first-class return ticket to London. I shall
      go up myself and give her in charge there. Here is some money,&rdquo; and
      he gave him a five-pound note, &ldquo;and look here, Jones, you need not
      trouble about the change.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Jones, to whom, his
      salary being a guinea a week, on which he supported a wife and family, a
      gift of four pounds was sudden wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t thank me, but do as I tell you. I will be down at the
      station at 7.10. Meet me outside and give me the ticket. That will do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Jones had gone Mr. Quest sat down to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      So George had loosed this woman on him, and that was the meaning of his
      mysterious warnings. How did he find her? That did not matter, he had
      found her, and in revenge for the action taken against the de la Molle
      family had brought her here to denounce him. It was cleverly managed, too.
      Mr. Quest reflected to himself that he should never have given the man
      credit for the brains. Well, that was what came of underrating people.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so this was the end of all his hopes, ambitions, shifts and struggles!
      The story would be in every paper in England before another twenty-four
      hours were over, headed, &ldquo;<i>Remarkable occurrence at Boisingham
      Quarter Sessions.&mdash;Alleged bigamy of a solicitor.</i>&rdquo; No
      doubt, too, the Treasury would take it up and institute a prosecution.
      This was the end of his strivings after respectability and the wealth that
      brings it. He had overreached himself. He had plotted and schemed, and
      hardened his heart against the de la Molle family, and fate had made use
      of his success to destroy him. In another few months he had expected to be
      able to leave this place a wealthy and respected man&mdash;and now? He
      laid his hand upon the table and reviewed his past life&mdash;tracing it
      from year to year, and seeing how the shadow of this accursed woman had
      haunted him, bringing disgrace and terror and mental agony with it&mdash;making
      his life a misery. And now what was to be done? He was ruined. Let him fly
      to the utmost parts of the earth, let him burrow in the recesses of the
      cities of the earth, and his shame would find him out. He was an impostor,
      a bigamist; one who had seduced an innocent woman into a mock marriage and
      then taken her fortune to buy the silence of his lawful wife. More, he had
      threatened to bring an action for divorce against a woman to whom he knew
      he was not really married and made it a lever to extort large sums of
      money or their value.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is there that a man in his position can do?
    </p>
    <p>
      He can do two things&mdash;he can revenge himself upon the author of his
      ruin, and he be bold enough, he can put an end to his existence and his
      sorrows at a blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Quest rose and walked to the door. Halting there, he turned and looked
      round the office in that peculiar fashion wherewith the eyes take their
      adieu. Then with a sigh he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching his own house he hesitated whether or not to enter. Had the news
      reached Belle? If so, how was he to face her? Her hands were not clean,
      indeed, but at any rate she had no mock marriage in her record, and her
      dislike of him had been unconcealed throughout. She had never wished to
      marry him, and never for one single day regarded him otherwise than with
      aversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      After reflection he turned and went round by the back way into the garden.
      The curtains of the French windows were drawn, but it was a wet and windy
      night, and the draught occasionally lifted the edge of one of them. He
      crept like a thief up to his own window and looked in. The drawing-room
      was lighted, and in a low chair by the fire sat Belle. She was as usual
      dressed in black, and to Mr. Quest, who loved her, and who knew that he
      was about to bid farewell to the sight of her, she looked more beautiful
      now than ever she had before. A book lay open on her knee, and he noticed,
      not without surprise, that it was a Bible. But she was not reading it; her
      dimpled chin rested on her hand, her violent eyes were fixed on vacancy,
      and even from where he was he thought that he could see the tears in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had heard nothing; he was sure of that from the expression of her
      face; she was thinking of her own sorrows, not of his shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he would go in.

      CHAPTER XXXVI. &mdash; HOW THE GAME ENDED
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Quest entered the house by a side door, and having taken off his hat
      and coat went into the drawing-room. He had still half an hour to spare
      before starting to catch the train.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Belle, looking up. &ldquo;Why are you looking so
      pale?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had a trying day,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;What have you
      been doing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing in particular.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reading the Bible, I see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; she asked, colouring a little, for she
      had thrown a newspaper over the book when she heard him coming in. &ldquo;Yes,
      I have been reading the Bible. Don&rsquo;t you know that when everything
      else in life has failed them women generally take to religion?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or drink,&rdquo; he put in, with a touch of his old bitterness.
      &ldquo;Have you seen Mr. Cossey lately?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Why do you ask that? I thought we had agreed to drop that
      subject.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact it had not been alluded to since Edward left the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that Miss de la Molle will not marry him after all?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know. She will not marry him because you forced him to give
      up the mortgages.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to be much obliged to me. Are you not pleased?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I no longer care about anything. I am tired of passion, and sin
      and failure. I care for nothing any more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems that we have both reached the same goal, but by different
      roads.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo; she answered, looking up; &ldquo;at any rate you are
      not tired of money, or you would not do what you have done to get it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never cared for money itself,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I only
      wanted money that I might be rich and, therefore, respected.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think any means justifiable so long as you get it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so. I do not think so now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you to-night, William. It is time for me
      to go to dress for dinner.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go just yet. I&rsquo;m leaving in a minute.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leaving? Where for?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;London; I have to go up to-night about some business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed; when are you coming back?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite know&mdash;to-morrow, perhaps. I wonder, Belle,&rdquo;
      he went on, his voice shaking a little, &ldquo;if you will always think as
      badly of me as you do now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; she said, opening her eyes widely; &ldquo;who am I that I
      should judge you? However bad you may be, I am worse.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps there are excuses to be made for both of us,&rdquo; he
      said; &ldquo;perhaps, after all, there is no such thing as free will, and
      we are nothing but pawns moved by a higher power. Who knows? But I will
      not keep you any longer. Good-bye&mdash;Belle!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I kiss you before I go?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him in astonishment. Her first impulse was to refuse. He had
      not kissed her for years. But something in the man&rsquo;s face touched
      her. It was always a refined and melancholy face, but to-night it wore a
      look which to her seemed almost unearthly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, William, if you wish,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but I wonder
      that you care to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the dead bury their dead,&rdquo; he answered, and stooping he
      put his arm round her delicate waist and drawing her to him kissed her
      tenderly but without passion on her forehead. &ldquo;There, good-night,&rdquo;
      he said; &ldquo;I wish that I had been a better husband to you.
      Good-night,&rdquo; and he was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached his room he flung himself for a few moments face downwards
      upon the bed, and from the convulsive motion of his back an observer might
      almost have believed that he was sobbing. When he rose, there was no trace
      of tears or tenderness upon his features. On the contrary, they were stern
      and set, like the features of one bent upon some terrible endeavour. Going
      to a drawer, he unlocked it and took from it a Colt&rsquo;s revolver of
      the small pattern. It was loaded, but he extracted the cartridges and
      replaced them with fresh ones from a tin box. Then he went downstairs, put
      on a large ulster with a high collar, and a soft felt hat, the brim of
      which he turned down over his face, placed the pistol in the pocket of his
      ulster, and started.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a dreadful night, the wind was blowing a heavy gale, and between
      the gusts the rain came down in sheets of driving spray. Nobody was about
      the streets&mdash;the weather was far too bad; and Mr. Quest reached the
      station without meeting a living soul. Outside the circle of light from a
      lamp over the doorway he paused, and looked about for the clerk Jones.
      Presently, he saw him walking backwards and forwards under the shelter of
      a lean-to, and going up, touched him on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man started back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got the ticket, Jones?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, sir,&rdquo; said Jones, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you in
      that get-up. Yes, here it is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the woman there still?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; she&rsquo;s taken a ticket, third-class, to town. She has
      been going on like a wild thing because they would not give her any liquor
      at the refreshment bar, till at last she frightened them into letting her
      have six of brandy. Then she began and told the girl all sorts of tales
      about you, sir&mdash;said she was going back to London because she was
      afraid that if she stopped here you would murder her&mdash;and that you
      were her lawful husband, and she would have a warrant out against you, and
      I don&rsquo;t know what all. I sat by and heard her with my own ears.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she&mdash;did she indeed?&rdquo; said Mr. Quest, with an
      attempt at a laugh. &ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s a common thief and worse,
      that&rsquo;s what she is, and by this time to-morrow I hope to see her
      safe in gaol. Ah! here comes the train. Good-night, Jones. I can manage
      for myself now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s his game?&rdquo; said Jones to himself as he watched
      his master slip on to the platform by a gate instead of going through the
      booking office. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve had four quid out of it, any way,
      and it&rsquo;s no affair of mine.&rdquo; And Jones went home to tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Mr. Quest was standing on the wet and desolate platform quite
      away from the lamps, watching the white lights of the approaching train
      rushing on through the storm and night. Presently it drew up. No
      passengers got out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, mam, look sharp if you&rsquo;re going,&rdquo; cried the
      porter, and the woman Edith came out of the refreshment room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the third, forrard there,&rdquo; said the porter,
      running to the van to see about the packing of the mails.
    </p>
    <p>
      On she came, passing quite close to Mr. Quest, so close that he could hear
      her swearing at the incivility of the porter. There was a third-class
      compartment just opposite, and this she entered. It was one of those
      carriages that are still often to be seen on provincial lines in which the
      partitions do not go up to the roof, and, if possible, more vilely lighted
      than usual. Indeed the light which should have illuminated the after-half
      of it had either never been lit or had gone out. There was not a soul in
      the whole length of the compartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as his wife was in, Mr. Quest watched his opportunity. Slipping up
      to the dark carriage, he opened and shut the door as quietly as possible
      and took his seat in the gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engine whistled, there was a cry of &ldquo;right forrard,&rdquo; and
      they were off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he saw the woman stand up in her division of the compartment and
      peep over into the gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a blessed soul,&rdquo; he heard her mutter, &ldquo;and yet I
      feel as though that devil Billy was creeping about after me. Ugh! it must
      be the horrors. I can see the look he gave me now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later the train stopped at a station, but nobody got in, and
      presently it moved on again. &ldquo;Any passengers for Effry?&rdquo;
      shouted the porter, and there had been no response. If they did not stop
      at Effry there would be no halt for forty minutes. Now was his time. He
      waited a little till they had got up the speed. The line here ran through
      miles and miles of fen country, more or less drained by dykes and rivers,
      but still wild and desolate enough. Over this great flat the storm was
      sweeping furiously&mdash;even drowning in its turmoil the noise of the
      travelling train.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very quietly he rose and climbed over the low partition which separated
      his compartment from that in which the woman was. She was seated in the
      corner, her head leaning back, so that the feeble light from the lamp fell
      on it, and her eyes were closed. She was asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slid himself along the seat till he was opposite to her, then paused to
      look at the fierce wicked face on which drink and paint and years of
      evil-thinking and living had left their marks, and looking shuddered.
      There was his bad genius, there was the creature who had driven him from
      evil to evil and finally destroyed him. Had it not been for her he might
      have been a good and respected man, and not what he was now, a fraudulent
      ruined outcast. All his life seemed to flash before his inner eye in those
      few seconds of contemplation, all the long weary years of struggle, crime,
      and deceit. And this was the end of it, and <i>there</i> was the cause of
      it. Well, she should not escape him; he would be revenged upon her at
      last. There was nothing but death before <i>him</i>, she should die too.
    </p>
    <p>
      He set his teeth, drew the loaded pistol from his pocket, cocked it and
      lifted it to her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the matter with the thing? He had never known the pull of a
      pistol to be so heavy before.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, it was not <i>that</i>. He could not do it. He could not shoot a
      sleeping woman, devil though she was; he could not kill her in her sleep.
      His nature rose up against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He placed the pistol on his knee, and as he did so she opened her eyes. He
      saw the look of wonder gather in them and grow to a stare of agonised
      terror. Her face became rigid like a dead person&rsquo;s and her lips
      opened to scream, but no cry came. She could only point to the pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make a sound and you are dead,&rdquo; he said fiercely. &ldquo;Not
      that it matters though,&rdquo; he added, as he remembered that the scream
      must be loud which could be heard in that raging gale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; she gasped at last. &ldquo;What
      are you going to do with that pistol? And where do you come from?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I come out of the night,&rdquo; he answered, raising the weapon,
      &ldquo;out of the night into which you are going.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not going to kill me?&rdquo; she moaned, turning up her
      ghastly face. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t die. I&rsquo;m afraid to die. It will
      hurt, and I&rsquo;ve been wicked. Oh, you are not going to kill me, are
      you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am going to kill you,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I told you
      months ago that I would kill you if you molested me. You have ruined me
      now, there is nothing but death left for <i>me</i>, and <i>you</i> shall
      die too, you fiend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no! no! no! anything but that. I was drunk when I did it; that
      man brought me there, and they had taken all my things, and I was
      starving,&rdquo; and she glanced wildly round the empty carriage to see if
      help could be found, but there was none. She was alone with her fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      She slipped down upon the floor of the carriage and clasped his knees.
      Writhing in her terror upon the ground, in hoarse accents she prayed for
      mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You used to kiss me,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you cannot kill a
      woman you used to kiss years ago. Oh, spare me, spare me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He set his lips and placed the muzzle of the pistol against her head. She
      shivered at the contact, and her teeth began to chatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not do it. He must let her go, and leave her to fate. After all,
      she could hurt him no more, for before another sun had set he would be
      beyond her reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      His pistol hand fell against his side, and he looked down with loathing
      not unmixed with pity at the abject human snake who was writing at his
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught his eye, and her faculties, sharpened by the imminent peril,
      read relentment there. For the moment, at any rate, he was softened. If
      she could master him now while he was off his guard&mdash;he was not a
      very strong man! But the pistol&mdash;&mdash; Slowly, still groaning out
      supplications, she rose to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;be quiet while I think if I can spare
      you,&rdquo; and he half turned his head away from her. For a moment
      nothing was heard but the rush of the gale and the roll of the wheels
      running over and under bridges.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was her opportunity. All her natural ferocity arose within her,
      intensified a hundred times by the instinct of self-protection. With a
      sudden blow she struck the pistol from his hand; it fell upon the floor of
      the carriage. And then with a scream she sprang like a wild cat straight
      at his throat. So sudden was the attack that the long lean hands were
      gripping his windpipe before he knew it had been made. Back she bore him,
      though he seized her round the waist. She was the heavier of the two, and
      back they went, <i>crash</i> against the carriage door.
    </p>
    <p>
      It gave! Oh, God, the worn catch gave! Out together, out with a yell of
      despair into the night and the raging gale; down together through sixty
      feet of space into the black river beneath. Down together, deep into the
      watery depths&mdash;into the abyss of Death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train rushed on, the wild winds blew, and the night was as the night
      had been. But there in the black water, though there was never a star to
      see them, there, locked together in death as they had been locked together
      in life, the fierce glare of hate and terror yet staring from their glazed
      eyes, two bodies rolled over and over as they sped silently towards the
      sea.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVII. &mdash; SISTER AGNES
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ten days had passed. The tragedy had echoed through all the land.
      Numberless articles and paragraphs had been written in numberless papers,
      and numberless theories had been built upon them. But the echoes were
      already beginning to die away. Both actors in the dim event were dead, and
      there was no pending trial to keep the public interest alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two corpses, still linked in that fierce dying grip, had been picked
      up on a mudbank. An inquest had been held, at which an open verdict was
      returned, and they were buried. Other events had occurred, the papers were
      filled with the reports of new tragedies, and the affair of the country
      lawyer who committed bigamy and together with his lawful wife came to a
      tragic and mysterious end began to be forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Boisingham and its neighbourhood much sympathy was shown with Belle,
      whom people still called Mrs. Quest, though she had no title to that name.
      But she received it coldly and kept herself secluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as her supposed husband&rsquo;s death was beyond a doubt Belle had
      opened his safe (for he had left the keys on his dressing-table), and
      found therein his will and other papers, including the mortgage deeds, to
      which, as Mr. Quest&rsquo;s memorandum advised her, she had no claim. Nor,
      indeed, had her right to them been good in law, would she have retained
      them, seeing that they were a price wrung from her late lover under threat
      of an action that could not be brought.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she made them into a parcel and sent them to Edward Cossey, together
      with a formal note of explanation, greatly wondering in her heart what
      course he would take with reference to them. She was not left long in
      doubt. The receipt of the deeds was acknowledged, and three days
      afterwards she heard that a notice calling in the borrowed money had been
      served upon Mr. de la Molle on behalf of Edward Cossey.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he had evidently made up his mind not to forego this new advantage
      which chance threw in his way. Pressure and pressure alone could enable
      him to attain his end, and he was applying it unmercifully. Well, she had
      done with him now, it did not matter to her; but she could not help
      faintly wondering at the extraordinary tenacity and hardness of purpose
      which his action showed. Then she turned her mind to the consideration of
      another matter, in connection with which her plans were approaching
      maturity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some days after this, exactly a fortnight from the date of Mr.
      Quest&rsquo;s death, that Edward Cossey was sitting one afternoon brooding
      over the fire in his rooms. He had much business awaiting his attention in
      London, but he would not go to London. He could not tear himself away from
      Boisingham, and such of the matters as could be attended to there were
      left without attention. He was still as determined as ever to marry Ida,
      more determined if possible, for from constant brooding on the matter he
      had arrived at a condition approaching monomania. He had been quick to see
      the advantage resulting to him from Mr. Quest&rsquo;s tragic death and the
      return of the deeds, and though he knew that Ida would hate him the more
      for doing it, he instructed his lawyers to call in the money and make use
      of every possible legal means to harass and put pressure upon Mr. de la
      Molle. At the same time he had written privately to the Squire, calling
      his attention to the fact that matters were now once more as they had been
      at the beginning, but that he was as before willing to carry out the
      arrangements which he had already specified, provided that Ida could be
      persuaded to consent to marry him. To this Mr. de la Molle had answered
      courteously enough, notwithstanding his grief and irritation at the course
      his would-be son-in-law had taken about the mortgages on the death of Mr.
      Quest, and the suspicion (it was nothing more) that he now had as to the
      original cause of their transfer to the lawyer. He said what he had said
      before, that he could not force his daughter into a marriage with him, but
      that if she chose to agree to it he should offer no objection. And there
      the matter stood. Once or twice Edward had met Ida walking or driving. She
      bowed to him coldly and that was all. Indeed he had only one crumb of
      comfort in his daily bread of disappointment, and the hope deferred which,
      where a lady is concerned, makes the heart more than normally sick, and it
      was that he knew his hated rival, Colonel Quaritch, had been forbidden the
      Castle, and that intercourse between him and Ida was practically at an
      end.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was a dogged and persevering man; he knew the power of money and
      the shifts to which people can be driven who are made desperate by the
      want of it. He knew, too, that it is no rare thing for women who are
      attached to one man to sell themselves to another of their own free will,
      realising that love may pass, but wealth (if the settlements are properly
      drawn) does not. Therefore he still hoped that with so many circumstances
      bringing an ever-increasing pressure upon her, Ida&rsquo;s spirit would in
      time be broken, her resistance would collapse, and he would have his will.
      Nor, as the sequel will show, was that hope a baseless one.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for his infatuation there was literally no limit to it. It broke out in
      all sorts of ways, and for miles round was a matter of public notoriety
      and gossip. Over the mantelpiece in his sitting-room was a fresh example
      of it. By one means and another he had obtained several photographs of
      Ida, notably one of her in a court dress which she had worn two or three
      years before, when her brother James had insisted upon her being
      presented. These photographs he caused to be enlarged and then, at the
      cost of 500 pounds, commissioned a well-known artist to paint from them a
      full-length life-size portrait of Ida in her court dress. This order had
      been executed, and the portrait, which although the colouring was not
      entirely satisfactory was still an effective likeness and a fine piece of
      work, now hung in a splendid frame over his mantelpiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, on the afternoon in question, he sat before the fire, his eyes
      fixed upon the portrait, of which the outline was beginning to grow dim in
      the waning December light, when the servant girl came in and announced
      that a lady wished to speak to him. He asked what her name was, and the
      girl said that she did not know, because she had her veil down and was
      wrapped up in a big cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      In due course the lady was shown up. He had relapsed into his reverie, for
      nothing seemed to interest him much now unless it had to do with Ida&mdash;and
      he knew that the lady could not be Ida, because the girl said that she was
      short. As it happened, he sat with his right ear, in which he was deaf,
      towards the door, so that between his infirmity and his dreams he never
      heard Belle&mdash;for it was she&mdash;enter the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a minute or more she stood looking at him as he sat with his eyes
      fixed upon the picture, and while she looked an expression of pity stole
      across her sweet pale face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what curse there is laid upon us that we should be always
      doomed to seek what we cannot find?&rdquo; she said aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard her now, and looking up saw her standing in the glow and flicker
      of the firelight, which played upon her white face and black-draped form.
      He started violently; as he did so she loosed the heavy cloak and hood
      that she wore and it fell behind her. But where was the lovely rounded
      form, and where the clustering golden curls? Gone, and in their place a
      coarse robe of blue serge, on which hung a crucifix, and the white hood of
      the nun.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sprang from his chair with an exclamation, not knowing if he dreamed or
      if he really saw the woman who stood there like a ghost in the firelight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Edward,&rdquo; she said presently, in her sweet low
      voice. &ldquo;I daresay that this all looks theatrical enough&mdash;but I
      have put on this dress for two reasons: firstly, because I must leave this
      town in an hour&rsquo;s time and wish to do so unknown; and secondly, to
      show that you need not fear that I have come to be troublesome. Will you
      light the candles?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He did so mechanically, and then pulled down the blinds. Meanwhile Belle
      had seated herself near the table, her face buried in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the meaning of all this, Belle?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sister Agnes,&rsquo; you must call me now,&rdquo; she said,
      taking her hands from her face. &ldquo;The meaning of it is that I have
      left the world and entered a sisterhood which works among the poor in
      London, and I have come to bid you farewell, a last farewell.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her in amazement. He did not find it easy to connect the idea
      of this beautiful, human, loving creature with the cold sanctuary of a
      sisterhood. He did not know that natures like this, whose very intensity
      is often the cause of their destruction, are most capable of these strange
      developments. The man or woman who can really love and endure&mdash;and
      they are rare&mdash;can also, when their passion has utterly broken them,
      turn to climb the stony paths that lead to love&rsquo;s antipodes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edward,&rdquo; she went on, speaking very slowly, &ldquo;you know
      in what relation we have stood to each other, and what that relationship
      means to woman. You know this&mdash;I have loved you with all my heart,
      and all my strength, and all my soul&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Here she
      trembled and broke down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, too,&rdquo; she continued presently, &ldquo;what has been
      the end of all this, the shameful end. I am not come to blame you. I do
      not blame you, for the fault was mine, and if I have anything to forgive I
      forgive it freely. Whatever memories may still live in my heart I swear I
      put away all bitterness, and that my most earnest wish is that you may be
      happy, as happiness is to you. The sin was mine; that is it would have
      been mine were we free agents, which perhaps we are not. I should have
      loved my husband, or rather the man whom I thought my husband, for with
      all his faults he was of a different clay to you, Edward.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she went on, pointing to the picture over the
      mantelpiece, &ldquo;that your mind is still set upon her, and I am
      nothing, and less than nothing, to you. When I am gone you will scarcely
      give me a thought. I cannot tell you if you will succeed in your end, and
      I think the methods you are adopting wicked and shameful. But whether you
      succeed or not, your fate also will be what my fate is&mdash;to love a
      person who is not only indifferent to you but who positively dislikes you,
      and reserves all her secret heart for another man, and I know no greater
      penalty than is to be found in that daily misery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very consoling,&rdquo; he said sulkily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only tell you the truth,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;What sort of
      life do you suppose mine has been when I am so utterly broken, so entirely
      robbed of hope, that I have determined to leave the world and hide myself
      and my shame in a sisterhood? And now, Edward,&rdquo; she went on, after a
      pause, &ldquo;I have something to tell you, for I will not go away, if
      indeed you allow me to go away at all after you have heard it, until I
      have confessed.&rdquo; And she leant forward and looked him full in the
      face, whispering&mdash;&ldquo;<i>I shot you on purpose, Edward!</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he said, springing from his chair; &ldquo;you tried to
      murder me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; but don&rsquo;t think too hardly of me. I am only flesh
      and blood, and you drove me wild with jealousy&mdash;you taunted me with
      having been your mistress and said that I was not fit to associate with
      the lady whom you were going to marry. It made me mad, and the opportunity
      offered&mdash;the gun was there, and I shot you. God forgive me, I think
      that I have suffered more than you did. Oh! when day after day I saw you
      lying there and did not know if you would live or die, I thought that I
      should have gone mad with remorse and agony!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened so far, and then suddenly walked across the room towards the
      bell. She placed herself between him and it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to do? I am going to send for a policeman and give you into
      custody for attempted murder, that is all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught his arm and looked him in the face. In another second she had
      loosed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you have a right to do that.
      Ring and send for the policeman, only remember that nothing is known now,
      but the whole truth will come out at the trial.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This checked him, and he stood thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you ring?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not ring,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;because on the whole I
      think I had better let you go. I do not wish to be mixed up with you any
      more. You have done me mischief enough; you have finished by attempting to
      murder me. Go; I think that a convent is the best place for you; you are
      too bad and too dangerous to be left at large.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Oh!</i>&rdquo; she said, like one in pain. &ldquo;<i>Oh!</i> and
      you are the man for whom I have come to this! Oh, God! it is a cruel
      world.&rdquo; And she pressed her hands to her heart and stumbled rather
      than walked to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching it she turned, and her hands still pressing the coarse blue gown
      against her heart, she leaned against the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edward,&rdquo; she said, in a strained whisper, for her breath came
      thick, &ldquo;Edward&mdash;I am going for ever&mdash;have you <i>no</i>
      kind word&mdash;to say to me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her, a scowl upon his handsome face. Then by way of answer he
      turned upon his heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, still holding her hands against her poor broken heart, she went
      out of the house, out of Boisingham and of touch and knowledge of the
      world. In after years these two were fated to meet once again, and under
      circumstances sufficiently tragic; but the story of that meeting does not
      lie within the scope of this history. To the world Belle is dead, but
      there is another world of sickness, and sordid unchanging misery and
      shame, where the lovely face of Sister Agnes moves to and fro like a ray
      of heaven&rsquo;s own light. There those who would know her must go to
      seek her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Belle! Poor shamed, deserted woman! She was an evil-doer, and the
      fatality of love and the unbalanced vigour of her mind, which might, had
      she been more happily placed, have led her to all things that are pure,
      and true, and of good report, combined to drag her into shame and
      wretchedness. But the evil that she did was paid back to her in full
      measure, pressed down and running over. Few of us need to wait for a place
      of punishment to get the due of our follies and our sins. <i>Here</i> we
      expiate them. They are with us day and night, about our path and about our
      bed, scourging us with the whips of memory, mocking us with empty longing
      and the hopelessness of despair. Who can escape the consequence of sin, or
      even of the misfortune which led to sin? Certainly Belle did not, nor Mr.
      Quest, nor even that fierce-hearted harpy who hunted him to his grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so good-bye to Belle. May she find peace in its season!
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVIII. &mdash; COLONEL QUARITCH EXPRESSES HIS VIEWS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Meanwhile things had been going very ill at the Castle. Edward Cossey&rsquo;s
      lawyers were carrying out their client&rsquo;s instructions to the letter
      with a perseverance and ingenuity worthy of a County Court solicitor. Day
      by day they found a new point upon which to harass the wretched Squire.
      Some share of the first expenses connected with the mortgages had, they
      said, been improperly thrown upon their client, and they again and again
      demanded, in language which was almost insolent, the immediate payment of
      the amount. Then there was three months&rsquo; interest overdue, and this
      also they pressed and clamoured for, till the old gentleman was nearly
      driven out of his senses, and as a consequence drove everybody about the
      place out of theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last this state of affairs began to tell upon his constitution, which,
      strong as he was, could not at his age withstand such constant worry. He
      grew to look years older, his shoulders acquired a stoop, and his memory
      began to fail him, especially on matters connected with the mortgages and
      farm accounts. Ida, too, became pale and ill; she caught a heavy cold,
      which she could not throw off, and her face acquired a permanently pained
      and yet listless look.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, it was on the 15th of December, things reached a climax. When Ida
      came down to breakfast she found her father busy poring over some more
      letters from the lawyers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it now, father?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it now?&rdquo; he answered irritably. &ldquo;What, it&rsquo;s
      another claim for two hundred, that&rsquo;s what it is. I keep telling
      them to write to my lawyers, but they won&rsquo;t, at least they write to
      me too. There, I can&rsquo;t make head or tail of it. Look here,&rdquo;
      and he showed her two sides of a big sheet of paper covered with
      statements of accounts. &ldquo;Anyhow, I have not got two hundred, that&rsquo;s
      clear. I don&rsquo;t even know where we are going to find the money to pay
      the three months&rsquo; interest. I&rsquo;m worn out, Ida, I&rsquo;m worn
      out! There is only one thing left for me to do, and that is to die, and
      that&rsquo;s the long and short of it. I get so confused with these
      figures. I&rsquo;m an old man now, and all these troubles are too much for
      me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not talk like that, father,&rdquo; she answered, not
      knowing what to say, for affairs were indeed desperate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, it&rsquo;s all very well to talk so, but facts are
      stubborn. Our family is ruined, and we must accept it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cannot the money be got anyhow? Is there <i>nothing</i> to be done?&rdquo;
      she said in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the good of asking me that? There is only one thing that
      can save us, and you know what it is as well as I do. But you are your own
      mistress. I have no right to put pressure on you. I don&rsquo;t wish to
      put pressure on you. You must please yourself. Meanwhile I think we had
      better leave this place at once, and go and live in a cottage somewhere,
      if we can get enough to support us; if not we must starve, I suppose. I
      cannot keep up appearances any longer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida rose, and with a strange sad light of resolution shining in her eyes,
      came to where her father was sitting, and putting her hands upon his
      shoulders, looked him in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;do you wish me to marry that man?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wish you to marry him? What do you mean?&rdquo; he said, not
      without irritation, and avoiding her gaze. &ldquo;It is no affair of mine.
      I don&rsquo;t like the man, if that&rsquo;s what you mean. He is acting
      like&mdash;well, like the cur that he is, in putting on the screw as he is
      doing; but, of course, that is the way out of it, and the only way, and
      there you are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she said again, &ldquo;will you give me ten days,
      that is, until Christmas Day? If nothing happens between this and then I
      will marry Mr. Edward Cossey.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden light of hope shone in his eyes. She saw it, though he tried to
      hide it by turning his head away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;as you wish; settle it one way
      or the other on Christmas Day, and then we can go out with the new year.
      You see your brother James is dead, I have no one left to advise me now,
      and I suppose that I am getting old. At any rate, things seem to be too
      much for me. Settle it as you like; settle it as you like,&rdquo; and he
      got up, leaving his breakfast half swallowed, and went off to moon
      aimlessly about the park.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she made up her mind at last. This was the end of her struggling. She
      could not let her old father be turned out of house and home to starve,
      for practically they would starve. She knew her hateful lover well enough
      to be aware that he would show no mercy. It was a question of the woman or
      the money, and she was the woman. Either she must let him take her or they
      must be destroyed; there was no middle course. And in these circumstances
      there was no room for hesitation. Once more her duty became clear to her.
      She must give up her life, she must give up her love, she must give up
      herself. Well, so be it. She was weary of the long endeavour against
      fortune, now she would yield and let the tide of utter misery sweep over
      her like a sea&mdash;to bear her away till at last it brought her to that
      oblivion in which perchance all things come right or are as though they
      had never been.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had scarcely spoken to her lover, Harold Quaritch, for some weeks. She
      had as she understood it entered into a kind of unspoken agreement with
      her father not to do so, and that agreement Harold had realised and
      respected. Since their last letters to each other they had met once or
      twice casually or at church, interchanged a few indifferent words, though
      their eyes spoke another story, touched each other&rsquo;s hands and
      parted. That was absolutely all. But now that Ida had come to this
      momentous decision she felt he had a right to learn it, and so once more
      she wrote to him. She might have gone to see him or told him to meet her,
      but she would not. For one thing she did not dare to trust herself on such
      an errand in his dear company, for another she was too proud, thinking if
      her father came to hear of it he might consider that it had a clandestine
      and underhand appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so she wrote. With all she said we need not concern ourselves. The
      letter was loving, even passionate, more passionate perhaps than one would
      have expected from a woman of Ida&rsquo;s calm and stately sort. But a
      mountain may have a heart of fire although it is clad in snows, and so it
      sometimes is with women who seem cold and unemotional as marble. Besides,
      it was her last chance&mdash;she could write him no more letters and she
      had much to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so I have decided, Harold,&rdquo; she said after telling him of
      all her doubts and troubles. &ldquo;I must do it, there is no help for it,
      as I think you will see. I have asked for ten days&rsquo; respite. I
      really hardly know why, except that it is a respite. And now what is there
      left to say to you except good-bye? I love you, Harold, I make no secret
      of it, and I shall never love any other. Remember all your life that I
      love you and have not forgotten you, and never can forget. For people
      placed as we are there is but one hope&mdash;the grave. In the grave
      earthly considerations fail and earthly contracts end, and there I trust
      and believe we shall find each other&mdash;or at the least forgetfulness.
      My heart is so sore I know not what to say to you, for it is difficult to
      put all I feel in words. I am overwhelmed, my spirit is broken, and I wish
      to heaven that I were dead. Sometimes I almost cease to believe in a God
      who can allow His creatures to be so tormented and give us love only that
      it may be daily dishonoured in our sight; but who am I that I should
      complain, and after all what are our troubles compared to some we know of?
      Well, it will come to an end at last, and meanwhile pity me and think of
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pity me and think of me; yes, but never see me more. As soon as
      this engagement is publicly announced, go away, the further the better.
      Yes, go to New Zealand, as you suggested once, and in pity of our human
      weakness never let me see your face again. Perhaps you may write to me
      sometimes&mdash;if Mr. Cossey will allow it. Go there and occupy yourself,
      it will divert your mind&mdash;you are still too young a man to lay
      yourself upon the shelf&mdash;mix yourself up with the politics of the
      place, take to writing; anything, so long as you can absorb yourself. I
      sent you a photograph of myself (I have nothing better) and a ring which I
      have worn night and day since I was a child. I think that it will fit your
      little finger and I hope you will always wear it in memory of me. It was
      my mother&rsquo;s. And now it is late and I am tired, and what is there
      more that a woman can say to the man she loves&mdash;and whom she must
      leave for ever? Only one word&mdash;Good-bye. Ida.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Harold got this letter it fairly broke him down. His hopes had been
      revived when he thought that all was lost, and now again they were utterly
      dashed and broken. He could see no way out of it, none at all. He could
      not quarrel with Ida&rsquo;s decision, shocking as it was, for the simple
      reason that he knew in his heart she was acting rightly and even nobly.
      But, oh, the thought of it made him mad. It is probable that to a man of
      imagination and deep feeling hell itself can invent no more hideous
      torture than he must undergo in the position in which Harold Quaritch
      found himself. To truly love some good woman or some woman whom he thinks
      good&mdash;for it comes to the same thing&mdash;to love her more than
      life, to hold her dearer even than his honour, to be, like Harold, beloved
      in turn; and then to know that this woman, this one thing for which he
      would count the world well lost, this light that makes his days beautiful,
      has been taken from him by the bitterness of Fate (not by Death, for that
      he could bear), taken from him, and given &mdash;for money or money&rsquo;s
      worth&mdash;to some other man! It is, perhaps, better that a man should
      die than that he should pass through such an experience as that which
      threatened Harold Quaritch now: for though the man die not, yet will it
      kill all that is best in him; and whatever triumphs may await him,
      whatever women may be ready in the future to pin their favours to his
      breast, life will never be for him what it might have been, because his
      lost love took its glory with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      No wonder, then, that he despaired. No wonder, too, that there rose up in
      his breast a great anger and indignation against the man who had brought
      this last extremity of misery upon them. He was just, and could make
      allowances for his rival&rsquo;s infatuation&mdash;which, indeed, Ida
      being concerned, it was not difficult for him to understand. But he was
      also, and above all things, a gentleman; and the spectacle of a woman
      being inexorably driven into a distasteful marriage by money pressure, put
      on by the man who wished to gain her, revolted him beyond measure, and,
      though he was slow to wrath, moved him to fiery indignation. So much did
      it move him that he took a resolution; Mr. Cossey should know his mind
      about the matter, and that at once. Ringing the bell, he ordered his
      dog-cart, and drove to Edward Cossey&rsquo;s rooms with the full intention
      of giving that gentleman a very unpleasant quarter-of-an-hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cossey was in. Fearing lest he should refuse to see him, the Colonel
      followed the servant up the stairs, and entered almost as she announced
      his name. There was a grim and even a formidable look upon his plain but
      manly face, and something of menace, too, in his formal and soldierly
      bearing; nor did his aspect soften when his eyes fell upon the full-length
      picture of Ida over the mantelpiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward Cossey rose with astonishment and irritation, not unmixed with
      nervousness, depicted on his face. The last person whom he wished to see
      and expected a visit from was Colonel Quaritch, whom in his heart he held
      in considerable awe. Besides, he had of late received such a series of
      unpleasant calls that it is not wonderful that he began to dread these
      interviews.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-day,&rdquo; he said coldly. &ldquo;Will you be seated?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel bowed his head slightly, but he did not sit down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To what am I indebted for the pleasure?&rdquo; began Edward Cossey
      with much politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last time I was here, Mr. Cossey,&rdquo; said the Colonel in his
      deep voice, speaking very deliberately, &ldquo;I came to give an
      explanation; now I come to ask one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. To come to the point, Miss de la Molle and I are attached to
      each other, and there has been between us an understanding that this
      attachment might end in marriage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! has there?&rdquo; said the younger man with a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the Colonel, keeping down his rising temper as
      well as he could. &ldquo;But now I am told, upon what appears to be good
      authority, that you have actually condescended to bring, directly and
      indirectly, pressure of a monetary sort to bear upon Miss de la Molle and
      her father in order to force her into a distasteful marriage with
      yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what the devil business of yours is it, sir,&rdquo; asked
      Cossey, &ldquo;what I have or have not done? Making every allowance for
      the disappointment of an unsuccessful suitor, for I presume that you
      appear in that character,&rdquo; and again he sneered, &ldquo;I ask, what
      business is it of yours?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is every business of mine, Mr. Cossey, because if Miss de la
      Molle is forced into this marriage, I shall lose my wife.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you will certainly lose her. Do you suppose that I am going to
      consider you? Indeed,&rdquo; he went on, being now in a towering passion,
      &ldquo;I should have thought that considering the difference of age and
      fortune between us, you might find other reasons than you suggest to
      account for my being preferred, if I should be so preferred. Ladies are
      apt to choose the better man, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite know what you mean by the &lsquo;better man,&rsquo;
      Mr. Cossey,&rdquo; said the Colonel quietly. &ldquo;Comparisons are
      odious, and I will make none, though I admit that you have the advantage
      of me in money and in years. However, that is not the point; the point is
      that I have had the fortune to be preferred to <i>you</i> by the lady in
      question, and <i>not</i> you to me. I happen to know that the idea of her
      marriage with you is as distasteful to Miss de la Molle as it is to me.
      This I know from her own lips. She will only marry you, if she does so at
      all, under the pressure of direst necessity, and to save her father from
      the ruin you are deliberately bringing upon him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Colonel Quaritch,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;have you quite
      done lecturing me? If you have, let me tell you, as you seem anxious to
      know my mind, that if by any legal means I can marry Ida de la Molle I
      certainly intend to marry her. And let me tell you another thing, that
      when once I am married it will be the last that you shall see of her, if I
      can prevent it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for your admissions,&rdquo; said Harold, still more
      quietly. &ldquo;So it seems that it is all true; it seems that you are
      using your wealth to harass this unfortunate gentleman and his daughter
      until you drive them into consenting to this marriage. That being so, I
      wish to tell you privately what I shall probably take some opportunity of
      telling you in public, namely, that a man who does these things is a cur,
      and worse than a cur, he is a <i>blackguard</i>, and <i>you</i> are such a
      man, Mr. Cossey.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward Cossey&rsquo;s face turned perfectly livid with fury, and he drew
      himself up as though to spring at his adversary&rsquo;s throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel held up his hand. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try that on with me,&rdquo;
      he said. &ldquo;In the first place it is vulgar, and in the second you
      have only just recovered from an accident and are no match for me, though
      I am over forty years old. Listen, our fathers had a way of settling their
      troubles; I don&rsquo;t approve of that sort of thing as a rule, but in
      some cases it is salutary. If you think yourself aggrieved it does not
      take long to cross the water, Mr. Cossey.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward Cossey looked puzzled. &ldquo;Do you mean to suggest that I should
      fight a duel with you?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To challenge a man to fight a duel,&rdquo; answered the Colonel
      with deliberation, &ldquo;is an indictable offence, therefore I make no
      such challenge. I have made a suggestion, and if that suggestion falls in
      with your views as,&rdquo; and he bowed, &ldquo;I hope it may, we might
      perhaps meet accidentally abroad in a few days&rsquo; time, when we could
      talk this matter over further.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you hanged first,&rdquo; answered Cossey. &ldquo;What
      have I to gain by fighting you except a very good chance of being shot? I
      have had enough of being shot as it is, and we will play this game out
      upon the old lines, until I win it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you like,&rdquo; said Harold. &ldquo;I have made a suggestion to
      you which you do not see fit to accept. As to the end of the game, it is
      not finished yet, and therefore it is impossible to say who will win it.
      Perhaps you will be checkmated after all. In the meanwhile allow me again
      to assure you that I consider you both a cur and a blackguard, and to wish
      you good-morning.&rdquo; And he bowed himself out, leaving Edward Cossey
      in a curious condition of concentrated rage.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIX. &mdash; THE COLONEL GOES TO SLEEP
    </h2>
    <p>
      The state of mind is difficult to picture which could induce a peaceable
      christian-natured individual, who had moreover in the course of his career
      been mixed up with enough bloodshed to have acquired a thorough horror of
      it, to offer to fight a duel. Yet this state had been reached by Harold
      Quaritch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward Cossey wisely enough declined to entertain the idea, but the
      Colonel had been perfectly in earnest about it. Odd as it may appear in
      the latter end of this nineteenth century, nothing would have given him
      greater pleasure than to put his life against that of his unworthy rival.
      Of course, it was foolish and wrong, but human nature is the same in all
      ages, and in the last extremity we fall back by instinct on those methods
      which men have from the beginning adopted to save themselves from
      intolerable wrong and dishonour, or, be it admitted, to bring the same
      upon others.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Cossey utterly declined to fight. As he said, he had had enough of
      being shot, and so there was an end of it. Indeed, in after days the
      Colonel frequently looked back upon this episode in his career with shame
      not unmingled with amusement, reflecting when he did so on the strange
      potency of that passion which can bring men to seriously entertain the
      idea of such extravagances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, there was nothing more to be done. He might, it is true, have seen
      Ida, and working upon her love and natural inclinations have tried to
      persuade her to cut the knot by marrying him off-hand. Perhaps he would
      have succeeded, for in these affairs women are apt to find the arguments
      advanced by their lovers weighty and well worthy of consideration. But he
      was not the man to adopt such a course. He did the only thing he could do&mdash;answered
      her letter by saying that what must be must be. He had learnt that on the
      day subsequent to his interview with his rival the Squire had written to
      Edward Cossey informing him that a decided answer would be given to him on
      Christmas Day, and that thereon all vexatious proceedings on the part of
      that gentleman&rsquo;s lawyers had been stayed for the time. He could now
      no longer doubt what the answer would be. There was only one way out of
      the trouble, the way which Ida had made up her mind to adopt.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he set to work to make his preparations for leaving Honham and this
      country for good and all. He wrote to land agents and put Molehill upon
      their books to be sold or let on lease, and also to various influential
      friends to obtain introductions to the leading men in New Zealand. But
      these matters did not take up all his time, and the rest of it hung
      heavily on his hands. He mooned about the place until he was tired. He
      tried to occupy himself in his garden, but it was weary work sowing crops
      for strange hands to reap, and so he gave it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow the time wore on until at last it was Christmas Eve; the eve, too,
      of the fatal day of Ida&rsquo;s decision. He dined alone that night as
      usual, and shortly after dinner some waits came to the house and began to
      sing their cheerful carols outside. The carols did not chime in at all
      well with his condition of mind, and he sent five shillings out to the
      singers with a request that they would go away as he had a headache.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly they went; and shortly after their departure the great gale
      for which that night is still famous began to rise. Then he fell to pacing
      up and down the quaint old oak-panelled parlour, thinking until his brain
      ached. The hour was at hand, the evil was upon him and her whom he loved.
      Was there no way out of it, no possible way? Alas! there was but one way
      and that a golden one; but where was the money to come from? He had it
      not, and as land stood it was impossible to raise it. Ah, if only that
      great treasure which old Sir James de la Molle had hid away and died
      rather than reveal, could be brought to light, now in the hour of his
      house&rsquo;s sorest need! But the treasure was very mythical, and if it
      had ever really existed it was not now to be found. He went to his
      dispatch box and took from it the copy he had made of the entry in the
      Bible which had been in Sir James&rsquo;s pocket when he was murdered in
      the courtyard. The whole story was a very strange one. Why did the brave
      old man wish that his Bible should be sent to his son, and why did he
      write that somewhat peculiar message in it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose Ida was right and that it contained a cypher or cryptograph which
      would give a clue to the whereabouts of the treasure? If so it was obvious
      that it would be one of the simplest nature. A man confined by himself in
      a dungeon and under sentence of immediate death would not have been likely
      to pause to invent anything complicated. It would, indeed, be curious that
      he should have invented anything at all under such circumstances, and when
      he could have so little hope that the riddle would be solved. But, on the
      other hand, his position was desperate; he was quite surrounded by foes;
      there was no chance of his being able to convey the secret in any other
      way, and he <i>might</i> have done so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold placed the piece of paper upon the mantelpiece, and sitting down in
      an arm-chair opposite began to contemplate it earnestly, as indeed he had
      often done before. In case its exact wording should not be remembered, it
      is repeated here. It ran: &ldquo;<i>Do not grieve for me, Edward, my son,
      that I am thus suddenly and wickedly done to death by rebel murderers, for
      nought happeneth but according to God&rsquo;s will. And now farewell,
      Edward, till we shall meet in heaven. My moneys have I hid, and on account
      thereof I die unto this world, knowing that not one piece shall Cromwell
      touch. To whom God shall appoint shall all my treasure be, for nought can
      I communicate.</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold stared and stared at this inscription. He read it forwards,
      backwards, crossways, and in every other way, but absolutely without
      result. At last, wearied out with misery of mind and the pursuit of a
      futile occupation, he dropped off sound asleep in his chair. This happened
      about a quarter to eleven o&rsquo;clock. The next thing he knew was that
      he suddenly woke up; woke up completely, passing as quickly from a
      condition of deep sleep to one of wakefulness as though he had never shut
      his eyes. He used to say afterwards that he felt as though somebody had
      come and aroused him; it was not like a natural waking. Indeed, so
      unaccustomed was the sensation, that for a moment the idea flashed through
      his brain that he had died in his sleep, and was now awakening to a new
      state of existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      This soon passed, however. Evidently he must have slept some time, for the
      lamp was out and the fire dying. He got up and hunted about in the dark
      for some matches, which at last he found. He struck a light, standing
      exactly opposite to the bit of paper with the copy of Sir James de la
      Molle&rsquo;s dying message on it. This message was neatly copied
      long-ways upon a half-sheet of large writing paper, such as the Squire
      generally used. It&rsquo;s first line ran as it was copied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Do not grieve for me, Edward, my son, that I am thus suddenly
      and wickedly done.</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, as the match burnt up, by some curious chance, connected probably
      with the darkness and the sudden striking of light upon his eyeballs, it
      came to pass that Harold, happening to glance thereon, was only able to
      read four letters of this first line of writing. All the rest seemed to
      him but as a blue connecting those four letters. They were:
    </p>
    <p>
      D...............E...............a...............d
    </p>
    <p>
      being respectively the initials of the first, the sixth, the eleventh, and
      the sixteenth words of the line given above.
    </p>
    <p>
      The match burnt out, and he began to hunt about for another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D-E-A-D,&rdquo; he said aloud, repeating the letters almost
      automatically. &ldquo;Why it spells &lsquo;<i>Dead</i>.&rsquo; That is
      rather curious.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Something about this accidental spelling awakened his interest very
      sharply&mdash;it was an odd coincidence. He lit some candles, and
      hurriedly examined the line. The first thing which struck him was that the
      four letters which went to make up the word &ldquo;dead&rdquo; were about
      equi-distant in the line of writing. Could it be? He hurriedly counted the
      words in the line. There were sixteen of them. That is after the first,
      one of the letters occurred at the commencement of every fifth word.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was certainly curious. Trembling with nervousness he took a pencil
      and wrote down the initial letter of every fifth word in the message,
      thus:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Do not grieve for me, Edward my son, that I am thus suddenly and
  D                     E                     a

  wickedly done to death by rebel murderers, for naught happeneth
           d                      m

  but according to God&rsquo;s will. And now farewell, Edward, till we
      a                            n

  shall meet in heaven. My moneys have I hid, and on account thereof
  s                        m                      o

  I die unto this world, knowing that not one piece shall Cromwell
        u                             n

  touch. To whom God shall appoint shall all my treasure be, for
  t                        a                             b

  nought can I communicate.
         c
</pre>
    <p>
      When he had done he wrote these initials in a line:
    </p>
    <p>
      DEadmansmountabc
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at them for a little&mdash;then he saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Great heaven! he had hit upon the reading of the riddle.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Dead Man&rsquo;s Mount</i>,&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      followed by the mysterious letters A.B.C.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breathless with excitement, he checked the letters again to see if by any
      chance he had made an error. No, it was perfectly correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead Man&rsquo;s Mount.&rdquo; That was and had been for centuries
      the name of the curious tumulus or mound in his own back garden. It was
      this mount that learned antiquarians had discussed the origin of so
      fiercely, and which his aunt, the late Mrs. Massey, had roofed at the cost
      of two hundred and fifty pounds, in order to prove that the hollow in the
      top had once been the agreeable country seat of an ancient British family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could it then be but a coincidence that after the first word the initial
      of every fifth word in the message should spell out the name of this
      remarkable place, or was it so arranged? He sat down to think it over,
      trembling like a frightened child. Obviously, it was <i>not</i> accident;
      obviously, the prisoner of more than two centuries ago had, in his
      helplessness, invented this simple cryptograph in the hope that his son
      or, if not his son, some one of his descendants would discover it, and
      thereby become master of the hidden wealth. What place would be more
      likely for the old knight to have chosen to secrete the gold than one that
      even in those days had the uncanny reputation of being haunted? Who would
      ever think of looking for modern treasure in the burying place of the
      ancient dead? In those days, too, Molehill, or Dead Man&rsquo;s Mount,
      belonged to the de la Molle family, who had re-acquired it on the break up
      of the Abbey. It was only at the Restoration, when the Dofferleigh branch
      came into possession under the will of the second and last baronet, Edward
      de la Molle, who died in exile, that they failed to recover this portion
      of the property. And if this was so, and Sir James, the murdered man, had
      buried his treasure in the mount, what did the mysterious letters A.B.C.
      mean? Were they, perhaps, directions as to the line to be taken to
      discover it? Harold could not imagine, nor, as a matter of fact, did he or
      anybody else ever find out either then or thereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida, indeed, used afterwards to laughingly declare that old Sir James
      meant to indicate that he considered the whole thing as plain as A.B.C.,
      but this was an explanation which did not commend itself to Harold&rsquo;s
      practical mind.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XL. &mdash; BUT NOT TO BED
    </h2>
    <p>
      Harold glanced at the clock; it was nearly one in the morning, time to go
      to bed if he was going. But he did not feel inclined to go to bed. If he
      did, with this great discovery on his mind he should not sleep. There was
      another thing; it was Christmas Eve, or rather Christmas Day, the day of
      Ida&rsquo;s answer. If any succour was to be given at all, it must be
      given at once, before the fortress had capitulated. Once let the
      engagement be renewed, and even if the money should subsequently be
      forthcoming, the difficulties would be doubled. But he was building his
      hopes upon sand, and he knew it. Even supposing that he held in his hand
      the key to the hiding place of the long-lost treasure, who knew whether it
      would still be there, or whether rumour had not enormously added to its
      proportions? He was allowing his imagination to carry him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still he could not sleep, and he had a mind to see if anything could be
      made of it. Going to the gun-room he put on a pair of shooting-boots, an
      old coat, and an ulster. Next he provided himself with a dark lantern and
      the key of the summer-house at the top of Dead Man&rsquo;s Mount, and
      silently unlocking the back door started out into the garden. The night
      was very rough, for the great gale was now rising fast, and bitterly cold,
      so cold that he hesitated for a moment before making up his mind to go on.
      However, he did go on, and in another two minutes was climbing the steep
      sides of the tumulus. There was a wan moon in the cold sky&mdash;the wind
      whistled most drearily through the naked boughs of the great oaks, which
      groaned in answer like things in pain. Harold was not a nervous or
      impressionable man, but the place had a spectral look about it, and he
      could not help thinking of the evil reputation it had borne for all those
      ages. There was scarcely a man in Honham, or in Boisingham either, who
      could have been persuaded to stay half an hour by himself on Dead Man&rsquo;s
      Mount after the sun was well down. Harold had at different times asked one
      or two of them what they saw to be afraid of, and they had answered that
      it was not what they saw so much as what they felt. He had laughed at the
      time, but now he admitted to himself that he was anything but comfortable,
      though if he had been obliged to put his feelings into words he could
      probably not have described them better than by saying that he had a
      general impression of somebody being behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he was not going to be frightened by this nonsense, so consigning
      all superstitions to their father the Devil, he marched on boldly and
      unlocked the summer-house door. Now, though this curious edifice had been
      designed for a summer-house, and for that purpose lined throughout with
      encaustic tiles, nobody as a matter of fact had ever dreamed of using it
      to sit in. To begin with, it roofed over a great depression some thirty
      feet or more in diameter, for the top of the mount was hollowed out like
      one of those wooden cups in which jugglers catch balls. But
      notwithstanding all the encaustic tiles in the world, damp will gather in
      a hollow like this, and the damp alone was an objection. The real fact
      was, however, that the spot had an evil reputation, and even those who
      were sufficiently well educated to know the folly of this sort of thing
      would not willingly have gone there for purposes of enjoyment. So it had
      suffered the general fate of disused places, having fallen more or less
      out of repair and become a receptacle for garden tools, broken cucumber
      frames and lumber of various sorts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold pushed the door open and entered, shutting it behind him. It was,
      if anything, more disagreeable in the empty silence of the wide place than
      it had been outside, for the space roofed over was considerable, and the
      question at once arose in his mind, what was he to do now that he had got
      there? If the treasure was there at all, probably it was deep down in the
      bowels of the great mound. Well, as he was on the spot, he thought that he
      might as well try to dig, though probably nothing would come of it. In the
      corner were a pickaxe and some spades and shovels. Harold got them,
      advanced to the centre of the space and, half laughing at his own folly,
      set to work. First, having lit another lantern which was kept there, he
      removed with the sharp end of the pickaxe a large patch of the encaustic
      tiles exactly in the centre of the depression. Then having loosened the
      soil beneath with the pick he took off his ulster and fell to digging with
      a will. The soil proved to be very sandy and easy to work. Indeed, from
      its appearance, he soon came to the conclusion that it was not virgin
      earth, but worked soil which had been thrown there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently his spade struck against something hard; he picked it up and
      held it to the lantern. It proved to be an ancient spear-head, and near it
      were some bones, though whether or no they were human he could not at the
      time determine. This was very interesting, but it was scarcely what he
      wanted, so he dug on manfully until he found himself chest deep in a kind
      of grave. He had been digging for an hour now, and was getting very tired.
      Cold as it was the perspiration poured from him. As he paused for breath
      he heard the church clock strike two, and very solemnly it sounded down
      the wild ways of the wind-torn winter night. He dug on a little more, and
      then seriously thought of giving up what he was somewhat ashamed of having
      undertaken. How was he to account for this great hole to his gardener on
      the following morning? Then and there he made up his mind that he would
      not account for it. The gardener, in common with the rest of the village,
      believed that the place was haunted. Let him set down the hole to the
      &ldquo;spooks&rdquo; and their spiritual activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still he dug on at the grave for a little longer. It was by now becoming a
      matter of exceeding labour to throw the shovelfuls of soil clear of the
      hole. Then he determined to stop, and with this view scrambled, not
      without difficulty, out of the amateur tomb. Once out, his eyes fell on a
      stout iron crowbar which was standing among the other tools, such an
      implement as is used to make holes in the earth wherein to set hurdles and
      stakes. It occurred to him that it would not be a bad idea to drive this
      crowbar into the bottom of the grave which he had dug, in order to
      ascertain if there was anything within its reach. So he once more
      descended into the hole and began to work with the iron crow, driving it
      down with all his strength. When he had got it almost as deep as it would
      go, that is about two feet, it struck something&mdash;something hard&mdash;there
      was no doubt of it. He worked away in great excitement, widening the hole
      as much as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it was masonry, or if it was not masonry it was something uncommonly
      like it. He drew the crow out of the hole, and, seizing the shovel,
      commenced to dig again with renewed vigour. As he could no longer
      conveniently throw the earth from the hole he took a &ldquo;skep&rdquo; or
      leaf basket, which lay handy, and, placing it beside him, put as much of
      the sandy soil as he could carry into it, and then lifting shot it on the
      edge of the pit. For three-quarters of an hour he laboured thus most
      manfully, till at last he came down on the stonework. He cleared a patch
      of it and examined it attentively, by the light of the dark lantern. It
      appeared to be rubble work built in the form of an arch. He struck it with
      the iron crow and it gave back a hollow sound. There was a cavity of some
      sort underneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      His excitement and curiosity redoubled. By great efforts he widened the
      spot of stonework already laid bare. Luckily the soil, or rather sand, was
      so friable that there was very little exertion required to loosen it. This
      done he took the iron crow, and inserting it beneath a loose flat stone
      levered it up. Here was a beginning, and having got rid of the large flat
      stone he struck down again and again with all his strength, driving the
      sharp point of the heavy crow into the rubble work beneath. It began to
      give, he could hear bits of it falling into the cavity below. There! it
      went with a crash, more than a square foot of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He leant over the hole at his feet, devoutly hoping that the ground on
      which he was standing would not give way also, and tried to look down.
      Next second he threw his head back coughing and gasping. The foul air
      rushing up from the cavity or chamber, or whatever it was, had half
      poisoned him. Then not without difficulty he climbed out of the grave and
      sat down on the pile of sand he had thrown up. Clearly he must allow the
      air in the place to sweeten a little. Clearly also he must have assistance
      if he was to descend into the great hole. He could not undertake this by
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat upon the edge of the pit wondering who there was that he might
      trust. Not his own gardener. To begin with he would never come near the
      place at night, and besides such people talk. The Squire? No, he could not
      rouse him at this hour, and also, for obvious reasons, they had not met
      lately. Ah, he had it. George was the man! To begin with he could be
      relied upon to hold his tongue. The episode of the production of the real
      Mrs. Quest had taught him that George was a person of no common powers. He
      could think and he could act also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold threw on his coat, extinguished the large stable lantern, and
      passing out, locked the door of the summer-house and started down the
      mount at a trot. The wind had risen steadily during his hours of work, and
      was now blowing a furious gale. It was about a quarter to four in the
      morning and the stars shone brightly in the hard clean-blown sky. By their
      light and that of the waning moon he struggled on in the teeth of the
      raging tempest. As he passed under one of the oaks he heard a mighty crack
      overhead, and guessing what it was ran like a hare. He was none too soon.
      A circular gust of more than usual fierceness had twisted the top right
      out of the great tree, and down it came upon the turf with a rending
      crashing sound that made his blood turn cold. After this escape he avoided
      the neighbourhood of the groaning trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      George lived in a neat little farmhouse about a quarter of a mile away.
      There was a short cut to it across the fields, and this he took,
      breathlessly fighting his way against the gale, which roared and howled in
      its splendid might as it swept across the ocean from its birthplace in the
      distances of air. Even the stiff hawthorn fences bowed before its breath,
      and the tall poplars on the skyline bent like a rod beneath the first rush
      of a salmon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Excited as he was, the immensity and grandeur of the sight and sounds
      struck upon him with a strange force. Never before had he felt so far
      apart from man and so near to that dread Spirit round Whose feet thousands
      of rolling worlds rush on, at Whose word they are, endure, and are not.
    </p>
    <p>
      He struggled forward until at last he reached the house. It was quite
      silent, but in one of the windows a light was burning. No doubt its
      occupants found it impossible to sleep in that wild gale. The next thing
      to consider was how to make himself heard. To knock at the door would be
      useless in that turmoil. There was only one thing to be done &mdash;throw
      stones at the window. He found a good-sized pebble, and standing
      underneath, threw it with such goodwill that it went right through the
      glass. It lit, as he afterwards heard, full upon the sleeping Mrs. George&rsquo;s
      nose, and nearly frightened that good woman, whose nerves were already
      shaken by the gale, into a fit. Next minute a red nightcap appeared at the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George!&rdquo; roared the Colonel, in a lull of the gale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; came the faint answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;Colonel Quaritch. Come down. I want to speak to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The head was withdrawn and a couple of minutes afterwards Harold saw the
      front door begin to open slowly. He waited till there was space enough,
      and then slipped in, and together they forced it to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop a bit, sir,&rdquo; said George; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll light the
      lamp;&rdquo; and he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next minute he stepped back in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what on arth hev you bin after, Colonel?&rdquo; he said,
      contemplating Harold&rsquo;s filth-begrimed face, and hands, and clothes.
      &ldquo;Is anything wrong up at the Castle, or is the cottage blown down?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Harold; &ldquo;listen. You&rsquo;ve heard tell
      of the treasure that old Sir James de la Molle buried in the time of the
      Roundheads?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. I&rsquo;ve heard tell of that. Hev the gale blown it up?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but by heaven I believe that I am in a fair way to find it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      George took another step back, remembering the tales that Mrs. Jobson had
      told, and not being by any means sure but that the Colonel was in a
      dangerous condition of lunacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a glass of something to drink, water or milk, and I&rsquo;ll
      tell you. I&rsquo;ve been digging all night, and my throat&rsquo;s like a
      limeskin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Digging, why where?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where? In Dead Man&rsquo;s Mount!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Dead Man&rsquo;s Mount?&rdquo; said George. &ldquo;Well, blow
      me, if that ain&rsquo;t a funny place to dig at on a night like this,&rdquo;
      and, too amazed to say anything more, he went off to get the milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold drank three glasses of milk, and then sat down to tell as much of
      his moving tale as he thought desirable.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLI. &mdash; HOW THE NIGHT WENT
    </h2>
    <p>
      George sat opposite to him, his hands on his knees, the red nightcap on
      his head, and a comical expression of astonishment upon his melancholy
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, when Harold had done, &ldquo;blow me if that
      ain&rsquo;t a master one. And yet there&rsquo;s folks who say that there
      ain&rsquo;t no such thing as Providence&mdash;not that there&rsquo;s
      anything prowided yet&mdash;p&rsquo;raps there ain&rsquo;t nawthing there
      after all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if there is or not, but I&rsquo;m going back to
      see, and I want you to come with me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now?&rdquo; said George rather uneasily. &ldquo;Why, Colonel, that
      bain&rsquo;t a very nice spot to go digging about in on a night like this.
      I niver heard no good of that there place&mdash;not as I holds by sich
      talk myself,&rdquo; he added apologetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Colonel, &ldquo;you can do as you like, but I&rsquo;m
      going back at once, and going down the hole, too; the gas must be out of
      it by now. There are reasons,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;why, if this money
      is to be found at all, it should be found this morning. To-day is
      Christmas Day, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, Colonel; I knows what you mean. Bless you, I know all
      about it; the old Squire must talk to somebody; if he don&rsquo;t he&rsquo;d
      bust, so he talks to me. That Cossey&rsquo;s coming for his answer from
      Miss Ida this morning. Poor young lady, I saw her yesterday, and she looks
      like a ghost, she du. Ah, he&rsquo;s a mean one, that Cossey. Laryer Quest
      warn&rsquo;t in it with him after all. Well, I cooked his goose for him,
      and I&rsquo;d give summut to have a hand in cooking that banker chap&rsquo;s
      too. You wait a minute, Colonel, and I&rsquo;ll come along, gale and
      ghostesses and all. I only hope it mayn&rsquo;t be after a fool&rsquo;s
      arrand, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; and he retired to put on his boots.
      Presently he appeared again, his red nightcap still on his head, for he
      was afraid that the wind would blow a hat off, and carrying an unlighted
      lantern in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Colonel, I&rsquo;m ready, sir, if you be;&rdquo; and they
      started.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gale was, if anything, fiercer than ever. Indeed, there had been no
      such wind in those parts for years, or rather centuries, as the condition
      of the timber by ten o&rsquo;clock that morning amply testified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This here timpest must be like that as the Squire tells us on in
      the time of King Charles, as blew the top of the church tower off on a
      Christmas night,&rdquo; shouted George. But Harold made no answer, and
      they fought their way onward without speaking any more, for their voices
      were almost inaudible. Once the Colonel stopped and pointed to the
      sky-line. Of all the row of tall poplars which he had seen bending like
      whips before the wind as he came along but one remained standing now, and
      as he pointed that vanished also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching the summer house in safety, they entered, and the Colonel shut
      and locked the door behind them. The frail building was literally rocking
      in the fury of the storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope the roof will hold,&rdquo; shouted George, but Harold took
      no heed. He was thinking of other things. They lit the lanterns, of which
      they now had three, and the Colonel slid down into the great grave he had
      so industriously dug, motioning to George to follow. This that worthy did,
      not without trepidation. Then they both knelt and stared down through the
      hole in the masonry, but the light of the lanterns was not strong enough
      to enable them to make out anything with clearness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said George, falling back upon his favourite
      expression in his amazement, as he drew his nightcapped head from the
      hole, &ldquo;if that ain&rsquo;t a master one, I niver saw a masterer,
      that&rsquo;s all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What be you a-going to du now, Colonel? Hev you a ladder here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Harold, &ldquo;I never thought of that, but I&rsquo;ve
      a good rope: I&rsquo;ll get it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Scrambling out of the hole, he presently returned with a long coil of
      stout rope. It belonged to some men who had been recently employed in
      cutting boughs off such of the oaks that needed attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      They undid the rope and let the end down to see how deep the pit was. When
      they felt that the end lay upon the floor they pulled it up. The depth
      from the hole to the bottom of the pit appeared to be about sixteen feet
      or a trifle more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold took the iron crow, and having made the rope fast to it fixed the
      bar across the mouth of the aperture. Then he doubled the rope, tied some
      knots in it, and let it fall into the pit, preparatory to climbing down
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But George was too quick for him. Forgetting his doubts as to the wisdom
      of groping about Dead Man&rsquo;s Mount at night, in the ardour of his
      burning curiosity he took the dark lantern, and holding it with his teeth
      passed his body through the hole in the masonry, and cautiously slid down
      the rope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; asked Harold in a voice tremulous with
      excitement, for was not his life&rsquo;s fortune trembling on the turn?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered George doubtfully. Harold looking down could
      see that he was holding the lantern above his head and staring at
      something very hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next moment a howl of terror echoed up from the pit, the lantern was
      dropped upon the ground and the rope began to be agitated with the utmost
      violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another two seconds George&rsquo;s red nightcap appeared followed by a
      face that was literally livid with terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me up for Goad&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;or he&rsquo;ll
      hev me by the leg!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He! who?&rdquo; asked the Colonel, not without a thrill of
      superstitious fear, as he dragged the panting man through the hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      But George would give no answer until he was out of the grave. Indeed had
      it not been for the Colonel&rsquo;s eager entreaties, backed to some
      extent by actual force, he would by this time have been out of the
      summer-house also, and half-way down the mount.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; roared the Colonel in the pit to George, who
      shivering with terror was standing on its edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a blessed ghost, that&rsquo;s what it is, Colonel,&rdquo;
      answered George, keeping his eyes fixed upon the hole as though he
      momentarily expected to see the object of his fears emerge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Harold doubtfully. &ldquo;What rubbish you
      talk. What sort of a ghost?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A white un,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;all bones like.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All bones?&rdquo; answered the Colonel, &ldquo;why it must be a
      skeleton.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say that he ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was the answer,
      &ldquo;but if he be, he&rsquo;s nigh on seven foot high, and sitting
      airing of hissel in a stone bath.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, rubbish,&rdquo; said the Colonel. &ldquo;How can a skeleton sit
      and air himself? He would tumble to bits.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but there he be, and they don&rsquo;t call this
      here place 'Dead Man&rsquo;s Mount&rsquo; for nawthing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Colonel argumentatively, &ldquo;a skeleton is
      a perfectly harmless thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if he&rsquo;s dead maybe, sir, but this one&rsquo;s alive, I
      saw him nod his head at me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, George,&rdquo; answered Harold, feeling that if this
      went on much longer he should lose his nerve altogether. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      not going to be scared. Great heavens, what a gust! I&rsquo;m going down
      to see for myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, Colonel,&rdquo; answered George, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll
      wait here till you come up again&mdash;that is if you iver du.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thrice did Harold look at the hole in the masonry and thrice did he shrink
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he shouted angrily, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be a fool; get
      down here and hand me the lantern.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      George obeyed with evident trepidation. Then Harold scrambled through the
      opening and with many an inward tremor, for there is scarcely a man on the
      earth who is really free from supernatural fears, descended hand over
      hand. But in so doing he managed to let the lantern fall and it went out.
      Now as any one will admit this was exceedingly trying. It is not pleasant
      to be left alone in the dark and underground in the company of an unknown
      &ldquo;spook.&rdquo; He had some matches, but what between fear and cold
      it was some time before he could get a light. Down in this deep place the
      rush of the great gale reached his ears like a faint and melancholy
      sighing, and he heard other tapping noises, too, or he thought he did,
      noises of a creepy and unpleasant nature. Would the matches never light?
      The chill and death-like damp of the place struck to his marrow and the
      cold sweat poured from his brow. Ah! at last! He kept his eyes steadily
      fixed upon the lantern till he had lit it and the flame was burning
      brightly. Then with an effort he turned and looked round him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this is what he saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, three or four paces from him, in the centre of the chamber of Death
      sat or rather lay a figure of Death. It reclined in a stone chest or
      coffin, like a man in a hip bath which is too small for him. The bony arms
      hung down on either side, the bony limbs projected towards him, the great
      white skull hung forward over the massive breast bone. It moved, too, of
      itself, and as it moved, the jaw-bone tapped against the breast and the
      teeth clacked gently together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Terror seized him while he looked, and, as George had done, he turned to
      fly. How could that thing move its head? The head ought to fall off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seizing the rope, he jerked it violently in the first effort of mounting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hev he got yew, Colonel?&rdquo; sung out George above; and the
      sound of a human voice brought him back to his sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered as boldly as he could, and then setting his
      teeth, turned and tottered straight at the Horror in the chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was there now, and holding the lantern against the thing, examined it.
      It was a skeleton of enormous size, and the skull was fixed with rusty
      wire to one of the vertebrae.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this evidence of the handiwork of man his fears almost vanished. Even
      in that company he could not help remembering that it is scarcely to be
      supposed that spiritual skeletons carry about wire with which to tie on
      their skulls.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a sigh of relief he held up the lantern and looked round. He was
      standing in a good-sized vault or chamber, built of rubble stone. Some of
      this rubble had fallen in to his left; but otherwise, though the
      workmanship showed that it must be of extreme antiquity, the stone lining
      was still strong and good. He looked upon the floor, and then for the
      first time saw that the nodding skeleton before him was not the only one.
      All round lay remnants of the dead. There they were, stretched out in the
      form of a circle, of which the stone kist was the centre.[*] One place in
      the circle was vacant; evidently it had once been occupied by the giant
      frame which now sat within the kist. Next he looked at the kist itself. It
      had all the appearance of one of those rude stone chests in which the very
      ancient inhabitants of this island buried the ashes of their cremated
      dead. But, if this was so, whence came the un-cremated skeletons?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [*] At Bungay, in Suffolk, there stood a mound or tumulus,
     on which was a windmill. Some years ago the windmill was
     pulled down, and the owner of the ground wishing to build a
     house upon its site, set to work to cart away the mound. His
     astonishment may be conceived when he found in the earth a
     great number of skeletons arranged in circles. These
     skeletons were of large size, and a gentleman who saw them
     informed me that he measured one. It was that of a man who
     must have been nearly seven feet high. The bones were,
     unhappily, carted away and thrown into a dyke. But no house
     has been built upon the resting-place of those unknown
     warriors. &mdash;Author.
</pre>
    <p>
      Perhaps a subsequent race or tribe had found the chamber ready prepared,
      and used it to bury some among them who had fallen in battle. It was
      impossible to say more, especially as with one exception there was nothing
      buried with the skeletons which would assist to identify their race or
      age. That exception was a dog. A dog had been placed by one of the bodies.
      Evidently from the position of the bones of its master&rsquo;s arms he had
      been left to his last sleep with his hand resting on the hound&rsquo;s
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bending down, Harold examined the seated skeleton more closely. It was, he
      discovered, accurately jointed together with strong wire. Clearly this was
      the work of hands which were born into the world long after the flesh on
      those mighty bones had crumbled into dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      But where was the treasure? He saw none. His heart sank as the idea struck
      him that he had made an interesting archaeological discovery, and that was
      all. Before undertaking a closer search he went under the hole and
      halloaed to George to come down as there was nothing but some bones to
      frighten him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This the worthy George was at length with much difficulty persuaded to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last he stood beside him in the vault, Harold explained to him
      what the place was and how ridiculous were his fears, without however
      succeeding in allaying them to any considerable extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      And really when one considers the position it is not wonderful that George
      was scared. For they were shut up in the bowels of a place which had for
      centuries owned the reputation of being haunted, faced by a nodding
      skeleton of almost superhuman size, and surrounded by various other
      skeletons all &ldquo;very fine and large,&rdquo; while the most violent
      tempest that had visited the country for years sighed away outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, his teeth chattering, &ldquo;if this ain&rsquo;t
      the masterest one that iver I did see.&rdquo; But here he stopped,
      language was not equal to the expression of his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Harold, with a heart full of anxiety, was turning the lantern
      this way and that in the hope of discovering some traces of Sir James&rsquo;s
      treasure, but naught could he see. There to the left the masonry had
      fallen in. He went to it and pulled aside some of the stones. There was a
      cavity behind, apparently a passage, leading no doubt to the secret
      entrance to the vault, but he could see nothing in it. Once more he
      searched. There was nothing. Unless the treasure was buried somewhere, or
      hidden away in the passage, it was non-existent.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet what was the meaning of that jointed skeleton sitting in the stone
      bath? It must have been put there for some purpose, probably to frighten
      would-be plunderers away. Could he be sitting on the money? He rushed to
      the chest and looked through the bony legs. No, his pelvis rested on the
      stone bottom of the kist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, George, it seems we&rsquo;re done,&rdquo; said Harold, with a
      ghastly attempt at a laugh. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no treasure here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s underneath that there stone corn bin,&rdquo;
      suggested George, whose teeth were still chattering. &ldquo;It should be
      here or hereabouts, surely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was an idea. Helping himself to the shoulder-blade of some deceased
      hero, Harold, using it as a trowel, began to scoop away the soft sand upon
      which the stone chest stood. He scooped and scooped manfully, but he could
      not come to the bottom of the kist.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped back and looked at it. It must be one of two things&mdash;either
      the hollow at the top was but a shallow cutting in a great block of stone,
      or the kist had a false bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sprang at it. Seizing the giant skeleton by the spine, he jerked it out
      of the kist and dropped it on one side in a bristling bony heap. Just as
      he did so there came so furious a gust of wind that, buried as they were
      in the earth, they literally felt the mound rock beneath it. Instantly it
      was followed by a frightful crash overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      George collapsed in terror, and for a moment Harold could not for the life
      of him think what had happened. He ran to the hole and looked up. Straight
      above him he could see the sky, in which the first cold lights of dawn
      were quivering. Mrs. Massey&rsquo;s summer-house had been blown bodily
      away, and the &ldquo;ancient British Dwelling Place&rdquo; was once more
      open to the sky, as it had been for centuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The summer-house has gone, George,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Thank
      goodness that we were not in it, or we should have gone too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lord, sir,&rdquo; groaned the unhappy George, &ldquo;this is an
      awful business. It&rsquo;s like a judgment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might have been if we had been up above instead of safe down
      here,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Come, bring that other lantern.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      George roused himself, and together they bent over the now empty kist,
      examining it closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stone bottom was not of quite the same colour as the walls of the
      chest, and there was a crack across it. Harold felt in his pocket and drew
      out his knife, which had at the back of it one of those strong iron hooks
      that are used to extract stones from the hoofs of horses. This hook he
      worked into the crack and managed before it broke to pull up a fragment of
      stone. Then, looking round, he found a long sharp flint among the rubbish
      where the wall had fallen in. This he inserted in the hole and they both
      levered away at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half of the cracked stone came up a few inches, far enough to allow them
      to get their fingers underneath it. So it <i>was</i> a false bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Catch hold,&rdquo; gasped the Colonel, &ldquo;and pull for your
      life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      George did as he was bid, and setting their knees against the hollowed
      stone, they tugged till their muscles cracked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a-moving,&rdquo; said George. &ldquo;Now thin, Colonel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Next second they both found themselves on the flat of their backs. The
      stone had given with a run.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up sprang Harold like a kitten. The broken stone was standing edgeways in
      the kist. There was something soft beneath it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The light, George,&rdquo; he said hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beneath the stone were some layers of rotten linen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it a shroud, or what?
    </p>
    <p>
      They pulled the linen out by handfuls. One! two! three!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Oh, great heaven!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      There, under the linen, were row on row of shining gold coins set
      edgeways.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment everything swam before Harold&rsquo;s eyes, and his heart
      stopped beating. As for George, he muttered something inaudible about its
      being a &ldquo;master one,&rdquo; and collapsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      With trembling fingers Harold managed to pick out two pieces of gold which
      had been disturbed by the upheaval of the stone, and held them to the
      light. He was a skilled numismatist, and had no difficulty in recognising
      them. One was a beautiful three-pound piece of Charles I., and the other a
      Spur Rial of James I.
    </p>
    <p>
      That proved it. There was no doubt that this was the treasure hidden by
      Sir James de la Molle. He it must have been also who had conceived the
      idea of putting a false bottom to the kist and setting up the skeleton to
      frighten marauders from the treasure, if by any chance they should enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a minute or two the men stood staring at each other over the great
      treasure which they had unearthed in that dread place, shaking with the
      reaction of their first excitement, and scarcely able to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How deep du it go?&rdquo; said George at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold took his knife and loosed some of the top coins, which were very
      tightly packed, till he could move his hand in them freely. Then he pulled
      out handful after handful of every sort of gold coin. There were Rose
      Nobles of Edward IV.; Sovereigns and Angels of Henry VII. and VIII.;
      Sovereigns, Half-Sovereigns and gold Crowns of Edward VI.; Sovereigns,
      Rials, and Angels of Mary; Sovereigns, Double Crowns and Crowns of
      Elizabeth; Thirty-shilling pieces, Spur Rials, Angels, Unites and Laurels
      of James I.; Three-pound pieces, Broads, and Half Broads of Charles I.;
      some in greater quantity and some in less; all were represented. Handful
      after handful did he pull out, and yet the bottom was not reached. At last
      he came to it. The layer of gold pieces was about twenty inches broad by
      three feet six long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must get this into the house, George, before any one is about,&rdquo;
      gasped the Colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, yes, for sure we must; but how be we a-going to carry it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold thought for a minute, and then acted thus. Bidding George stay in
      the vault with the treasure, which he was with difficulty persuaded to do,
      he climbed the improvised rope ladder, and got in safety through the hole.
      In his excitement he had forgotten about the summer-house having been
      carried away by the gale, which was still blowing, though not with so much
      fury as before. The wind-swept desolation that met his view as he emerged
      into the dawning light broke upon him with a shock. The summer-house was
      clean gone, nothing but a few uprights remained of it; and fifty yards
      away he thought he could make out the crumpled shape of the roof. Nor was
      that all. Quite a quarter of the great oaks which were the glory of the
      place were down, or splintered and ruined.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what did he care for the summer-house or the oaks now? Forgetting his
      exhaustion, he ran down the slope and reached the house, which he entered
      as softly as he could by the side door. Nobody was about yet, or would be
      for another hour. It was Christmas Day, and not a pleasant morning to get
      up on, so the servants would be sure to lie a-bed. On his way to his
      bed-room he peeped into the dining-room, where he had fallen asleep on the
      previous evening. When he had woke up, it may be remembered, he lit a
      candle. This candle was now flaring itself to death, for he had forgotten
      to extinguish it, and by its side lay the paper from which he had made the
      great discovery. There was nothing in it, of course, but somehow the sight
      impressed him very much. It seemed months since he awoke to find the lamp
      gone out. How much may happen between the lighting of a candle and its
      burning away! Smiling at this trite reflection, he blew that light out,
      and, taking another, went to his room. Here he found a stout hand-bag,
      with which he made haste to return to the Mount.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you all right, George?&rdquo; he shouted down the hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Colonel, yes, but not sorry to see you back. It&rsquo;s
      lonesome like down here with these deaders.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Look out! There&rsquo;s a bag. Put as much gold in it as
      you can lift comfortably, and then make it fast to the rope.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Some three minutes passed, and then George announced that the bagful of
      gold was ready. Harold hauled away, and with a considerable effort brought
      it to the surface. Then, lifting the bag on his shoulder he staggered with
      it to the house. In his room stood a massive sea-going chest, the
      companion of his many wanderings. It was about half full of uniforms and
      old clothes, which he bundled unceremoniously on to the floor. This done,
      he shot the bagful of shining gold, as bright and uncorrupted now as when
      it was packed away two and a half centuries ago, into the chest, and
      returned for another load.
    </p>
    <p>
      About twenty times did he make this journey. At the tenth something
      happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a writing, sir, with this lot,&rdquo; shouted George.
      &ldquo;It was packed away in the money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the &ldquo;writing,&rdquo; or rather parchment, out of the mouth
      of the bag, and put it in his pocket unread.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the store, enormous as it was, was exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the lot, sir,&rdquo; shouted George, as he sent up the
      last bagful. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll kindly let down that there rope, I&rsquo;ll
      come up too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the Colonel, &ldquo;put the skeleton back
      first.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; answered George, &ldquo;he looks wonderful
      comfortable where he lay, he du, so if you&rsquo;re agreeable I think I&rsquo;ll
      let him be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold chuckled, and presently George arrived, covered with filth and
      perspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I never did think that I should
      get dead tired of handling gold coin, but it&rsquo;s a rum world, and that&rsquo;s
      a fact. Well, I niver, and the summer-house gone, and jist look at thim
      there oaks. Well, if that beant a master one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never saw a masterer, that&rsquo;s what you were going to say,
      wasn&rsquo;t it? Well, and take one thing with another, nor did I, George,
      if that&rsquo;s any comfort to you. Now look here, just cover over this
      hole with some boards and earth, and then come in and get some breakfast.
      It&rsquo;s past eight o&rsquo;clock and the gale is blowing itself out. A
      merry Christmas to you, George!&rdquo; and he held out his hand, covered
      with cuts, grime and blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      George shook it. &ldquo;Same to you, Colonel, I&rsquo;m sure. And a merry
      Christmas it is. God bless you, sir, for what you&rsquo;ve done to-night.
      You&rsquo;ve saved the old place from that banker chap, that&rsquo;s what
      you&rsquo;ve done; and you&rsquo;ll hev Miss Ida, and I&rsquo;m durned
      glad on it, that I am. Lord! won&rsquo;t this make the Squire open his
      eyes,&rdquo; and the honest fellow brushed away a tear and fairly capered
      with joy, his red nightcap waving on the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a strange and beautiful sight to see the solemn George capering
      thus in the midst of that storm-swept desolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold was too moved to answer, so he shouldered his last load of treasure
      and limped off with it to the house. Mrs. Jobson and her talkative niece
      were up now, but they did not happen to see him, and he reached his room
      unnoticed. He poured the last bagful of gold into the chest, smoothed it
      down, shut the lid and locked it. Then as he was, covered with filth and
      grime, bruised and bleeding, his hair flying wildly about his face, he sat
      down upon it, and from his heart thanked heaven for the wonderful thing
      that had happened to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So exhausted was he that he nearly fell asleep as he sat, but remembering
      himself rose, and taking the parchment from his pocket cut the faded silk
      with which it was tied and opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On it was a short inscription in the same crabbed writing which he had
      seen in the old Bible that Ida had found.
    </p>
    <p>
      It ran as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seeing that the times be so troublous that no man can be sure of
      his own, I, Sir James de la Molle, have brought together all my substance
      in money from wheresoever it lay at interest, and have hid the same in
      this sepulchre, to which I found the entry by a chance, till such time as
      peace come back to this unhappy England. This have I done on the early
      morn of Christmas Day, in the year of our Lord 1642, having ended the
      hiding of the gold while the great gale was blowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;James de la Molle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus on a long gone Christmas Day, in the hour of a great wind, was the
      gold hid, and now on this Christmas Day, when another great wind raged
      overhead, it was found again, in time to save a daughter of the house of
      de la Molle from a fate sore as death.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLII. &mdash; IDA GOES TO MEET HER FATE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Most people of a certain age and a certain degree of sensitiveness, in
      looking back down the vista of their lives, whereon memory&rsquo;s
      melancholy light plays in fitful flashes like the alternate glow of a
      censer swung in the twilight of a tomb, can recall some one night of
      peculiar mental agony. It may have come when first we found ourselves face
      to face with the chill and hopeless horror of departed life; when, in our
      soul&rsquo;s despair, we stretched out vain hands and wept, called and no
      answer came; when we kissed those beloved lips and shrunk aghast at
      contact with their clay, those lips more eloquent now in the rich pomp of
      their unutterable silence than in the brightest hour of their unsealing.
      It may have come when our honour and the hope of all our days lay at our
      feet shattered like a sherd on the world&rsquo;s hard road. It may have
      come when she, the star of our youth, the type of completed beauty and
      woman&rsquo;s most perfect measure, she who held the chalice of our hope,
      ruthlessly emptied and crushed it, and, as became a star, passed down our
      horizon&rsquo;s ways to rise upon some other sky. It may have come when
      Brutus stabbed us, or when a child whom we had cherished struck us with a
      serpent-fang of treachery and left the poison to creep upon our heart. One
      way or another it has been with most of us, that long night of utter woe,
      and all will own that it is a ghastly thing to face.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so Ida de la Molle had found it. The shriek of the great gale rushing
      on that Christmas Eve round the stout Norman towers was not more strong
      than the breath of the despair which shook her life. She could not sleep&mdash;who
      could sleep on such a night, the herald of such a morrow? The wail and
      roar of the wind, the crash of falling trees, and the rattle of flying
      stones seemed to form a fit accompaniment to the turmoil of her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose, went to the window, and in the dim light watched the trees
      gigantically tossing in struggle for their life. An oak and a birch were
      within her view. The oak stood the storm out&mdash;for a while. Presently
      there came an awful gust and beat upon it. It would not bend, and the
      tough roots would not give, so beneath the weight of the gale the big tree
      broke in two like a straw, and its spreading top was whirled into the
      moat. But the birch gave and bent; it bent till its delicate filaments lay
      upon the wind like a woman&rsquo;s streaming hair, and the fierceness of
      the blast wore itself away and spared it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See what happens to those who stand up and defy their fate,&rdquo;
      said Ida to herself with a bitter laugh. &ldquo;The birch has the best of
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida turned and closed the shutters; the sight of the tempest affected her
      strained nerves almost beyond bearing. She began to walk up and down the
      big room, flitting like a ghost from end to end and back again, and again
      back. What could she do? What should she do? Her fate was upon her: she
      could no longer resist the inevitable&mdash;she must marry him. And yet
      her whole soul revolted from the act with an overwhelming fierceness which
      astonished even herself. She had known two girls who had married people
      whom they did not like, being at the time, or pretending to be, attached
      to somebody else, and she had observed that they accommodated themselves
      to their fate with considerable ease. But it was not so with her; she was
      fashioned of another clay, and it made her faint to think of what was
      before her. And yet the prospect was one on which she could expect little
      sympathy. Her own father, although personally he disliked the man whom she
      must marry, was clearly filled with amazement that she should prefer
      Colonel Quaritch, middle-aged, poor, and plain, to Edward Cossey&mdash;handsome,
      young, and rich as Croesus. He could not comprehend or measure the
      extraordinary gulf which her love dug between the two. If, therefore, this
      was so with her own father, how would it be with the rest of the world?
    </p>
    <p>
      She paced her bedroom till she was tired; then, in an access of despair,
      which was sufficiently distressing in a person of her reserved and stately
      manner, flung herself, weeping and sobbing, upon her knees, and resting
      her aching head upon the bed, prayed as she had never prayed before that
      this cup might pass from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not know&mdash;how should she?&mdash;that at this very moment her
      prayer was being answered, and that her lover was then, even as she
      prayed, lifting the broken stone and revealing the hoard of ruddy gold.
      But so it was; she prayed in despair and agony of mind, and the prayer
      carried on the wild wings of the night brought a fulfilment with it. Not
      in vain were her tears and supplications, for even now the deliverer
      delved among
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dust and awful treasures of the dead,&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      and even now the light of her happiness was breaking on her tortured night
      as the cold gleams of the Christmas morning were breaking over the fury of
      the storm without.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, chilled and numb in body and mind, she crept into her bed again
      and at last lost herself in sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      By half-past nine o&rsquo;clock, when Ida came down to breakfast, the gale
      had utterly gone, though its footprints were visible enough in shattered
      trees, unthatched stacks, and ivy torn in knotty sheets from the old walls
      it clothed. It would have been difficult to recognise in the cold and
      stately lady who stood at the dining-room window, noting the havoc and
      waiting for her father to come in, the lovely, passionate, dishevelled
      woman who some few hours before had thrown herself upon her knees praying
      to God for the succour she could not win from man. Women, like nature,
      have many moods and many aspects to express them. The hot fit had passed,
      and the cold fit was on her now. Her face, except for the dark hollows
      round the eyes, was white as winter, and her heart was cold as winter&rsquo;s
      ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently her father came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a gale,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what a gale! Upon my word I
      began to think that the old place was coming down about our ears, and the
      wreck among the trees is dreadful. I don&rsquo;t think there can have been
      such a wind since the time of King Charles I., when the top of the tower
      was blown right off the church. You remember I was showing you the entry
      about it in the registers the other day, the one signed by the parson and
      old Sir James de la Molle. The boy who has just come up with the letters
      tells me he hears that poor old Mrs. Massey&rsquo;s summer-house on the
      top of Dead Man&rsquo;s Mount has been blown away, which is a good
      riddance for Colonel Quaritch. Why, what&rsquo;s the matter with you,
      dear? How pale you look!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gale kept me awake. I got very little sleep,&rdquo; answered
      Ida.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no wonder. Well, my love, you haven&rsquo;t wished me a merry
      Christmas yet. Goodness knows we want one badly enough. There has not been
      much merriment at Honham of late years.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A merry Christmas to you, father,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Ida, the same to you; you have got most of your
      Christmases before you, which is more than I have. God bless me, it only
      seems like yesterday since the big bunch of holly tied to the hook in the
      ceiling there fell down on the breakfast table and smashed all the cups,
      and yet it is more than sixty years ago. Dear me! how angry my poor mother
      was. She never could bear the crockery to be broken&mdash;it was a little
      failing of your grandmother&rsquo;s,&rdquo; and he laughed more heartily
      than Ida had heard him do for some weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made no answer but busied herself about the tea. Presently, glancing
      up she saw her father&rsquo;s face change. The worn expression came back
      upon it and he lost his buoyant bearing. Evidently a new thought had
      struck him, and she was in no great doubt as to what it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had better get on with breakfast,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
      know that Cossey is coming up at ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo; she said faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I told him ten so that we could go to church afterwards if we
      wished to. Of course, Ida, I am still in the dark as to what you have made
      up your mind to do, but whatever it is I thought that he had better once
      and for all hear your final decision from your own lips. If, however, you
      feel yourself at liberty to tell it to me as your father, I shall be glad
      to hear it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifted her head and looked him full in the face, and then paused. He
      had a cup of tea in his hand, and held it in the air half way to his
      mouth, while his whole face showed the over-mastering anxiety with which
      he was awaiting her reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make your mind easy, father,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am going to
      marry Mr. Cossey.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He put the cup down in such a fashion that he spilt half the tea, most of
      it over his own clothes, without even noticing it, and then turned away
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of course it is not my affair, or at
      least only indirectly so, but I must say, my love, I congratulate you on
      the decision which you have come to. I quite understand that you have been
      in some difficulty about the matter; young women often have been before
      you, and will be again. But to be frank, Ida, that Quaritch business was
      not at all suitable, either in age, fortune, or in anything else. Yes,
      although Cossey is not everything that one might wish, on the whole I
      congratulate you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, pray don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; broke in Ida, almost with a cry.
      &ldquo;Whatever you do, pray do not congratulate me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father turned round again and looked at her. But Ida&rsquo;s face had
      already recovered its calm, and he could make nothing of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand you,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;these
      things are generally considered matters for congratulation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But for all he might say and all that he might urge in his mind to the
      contrary, he did more or less understand what her outburst meant. He could
      not but know that it was the last outcry of a broken spirit. In his heart
      he realised then, if he had never clearly realised it before, that this
      proposed marriage was a thing hateful to his daughter, and his conscience
      pricked him sorely. And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;it was but a woman&rsquo;s
      fancy&mdash;a passing fancy. She would become reconciled to the inevitable
      as women do, and when her children came she would grow accustomed to her
      sorrow, and her trouble would be forgotten in their laughter. And if not,
      well it was but one woman&rsquo;s life which would be affected, and the
      very existence of his race and the very cradle that had nursed them from
      century to century were now at stake. Was all this to be at the mercy of a
      girl&rsquo;s whim? No! let the individual suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he argued. And so at his age and in his circumstances most of us would
      argue also, and, perhaps, considering all things, we should be right. For
      in this world personal desires must continually give way to the welfare of
      others. Did they not do so our system of society could not endure.
    </p>
    <p>
      No more was said upon the subject. Ida made pretence of eating a piece of
      toast; the Squire mopped up the tea upon his clothes, and then drank some
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the remorseless seconds crept on. It wanted but five minutes to
      the hour, and the hour would, she well knew, bring the man with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The five minutes passed slowly and in silence. Both her father and herself
      realised the nature of the impending situation, but neither of them spoke
      of it. Ah! there was the sound of wheels upon the gravel. So it had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida felt like death itself. Her pulse sunk and fluttered; her vital forces
      seemed to cease their work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another two minutes went by, then the door opened and the parlour-maid
      came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Cossey, if you please, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the Squire. &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the vestibule, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. Tell him I will be there in a minute.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Ida,&rdquo; said her father, &ldquo;I suppose that we had
      better get this business over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, rising; &ldquo;I am ready.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And gathering up her energies, she passed out to meet her fate.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIII. &mdash; GEORGE IS SEEN TO LAUGH
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ida and her father reached the vestibule to find Edward Cossey standing
      with his face to the mantelpiece and nervously toying with some
      curiosities upon it. He was, as usual, dressed with great care, and his
      face, though white and worn from the effects of agitation of mind, looked
      if anything handsomer than ever. As soon as he heard them coming, which
      owing to his partial deafness he did not do till they were quite close to
      him, he turned round with a start, and a sudden flush of colour came upon
      his pale face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire shook hands with him in a solemn sort of way, as people do when
      they meet at a funeral, but Ida barely touched his outstretched fingers
      with her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few random remarks followed about the weather, which really for once in
      a way was equal to the conversational strain put upon it. At length these
      died away and there came an awful pause. It was broken by the Squire, who,
      standing with his back to the fire, his eyes fixed upon the wall opposite,
      after much humming and hawing, delivered himself thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand, Mr. Cossey, that you have come to hear my daughter&rsquo;s
      final decision on the matter of the proposal of marriage which you have
      made and renewed to her. Now, of course, this is a very important
      question, very important indeed, and it is one with which I cannot presume
      even to seem to interfere. Therefore, I shall without comment leave my
      daughter to speak for herself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment before she does so,&rdquo; Mr. Cossey interrupted,
      drawing indeed but a poor augury of success from Ida&rsquo;s icy looks.
      &ldquo;I have come to renew my offer and to take my final answer, and I
      beg Miss de la Molle to consider how deep and sincere must be that
      affection which has endured through so many rebuffs. I know, or at least I
      fear, that I do not occupy the place in her feelings that I should wish
      to, but I look to time to change this; at any rate I am willing to take my
      chance. As regards money, I repeat the offer which I have already made.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, I should not say too much about that,&rdquo; broke in the
      Squire impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, why not?&rdquo; said Ida, in bitter sarcasm. &ldquo;Mr. Cossey
      knows it is a good argument. I presume, Mr. Cossey, that as a preliminary
      to the renewal of our engagement, the persecution of my father which is
      being carried on by your lawyers will cease?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if the engagement is not renewed the money will of course be
      called in?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lawyers advise that it should be,&rdquo; he answered sullenly;
      &ldquo;but see here, Ida, you may make your own terms about money.
      Marriage, after all, is very much a matter of bargaining, and I am not
      going to stand out about the price.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are really most generous,&rdquo; went on Ida in the same bitter
      tone, the irony of which made her father wince, for he understood her mood
      better than did her lover. &ldquo;I only regret that I cannot appreciate
      such generosity more than I do. But it is at least in my power to give you
      the return which you deserve. So I can no longer hesitate, but once and
      for all&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped dead, and stared at the glass door as though she saw a ghost.
      Both her father and Edward Cossey followed the motion of her eyes, and
      this was what they saw. Up the steps came Colonel Quaritch and George.
      Both were pale and weary-looking, but the former was at least clean. As
      for George, this could not be said. His head was still adorned with the
      red nightcap, his hands were cut and dirty, and on his clothes was an
      unlimited quantity of encrusted filth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the dickens&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began the Squire, and at that
      moment George, who was leading, knocked at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t come in now,&rdquo; roared the Squire; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
      you see that we are engaged?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we must come in, Squire, begging your pardon,&rdquo; answered
      George, with determination, as he opened the door; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got
      that to say as won&rsquo;t keep.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you that it must keep, sir,&rdquo; said the old gentleman,
      working himself into a rage. &ldquo;Am I not to be allowed a moment&rsquo;s
      privacy in my own house? I wonder at your conduct, Colonel Quaritch, in
      forcing your presence upon me when I tell you that it is not wanted.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure that I apologise, Mr. de la Molle,&rdquo; began the
      Colonel, utterly taken aback, &ldquo;but what I have to say is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best way that you can apologise is by withdrawing,&rdquo;
      answered the Squire with majesty. &ldquo;I shall be most happy to hear
      what you have to say on another occasion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Squire, Squire, don&rsquo;t be such a fule, begging your pardon
      for the word,&rdquo; said George, in exasperation. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
      go a-knocking of your head agin a brick wall.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be off, sir?&rdquo; roared his master in a voice that made
      the walls shake.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Ida had recovered herself. She seemed to feel that her lover
      had something to say which concerned her deeply&mdash;probably she read it
      in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she said, raising her voice, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t
      have Colonel Quaritch turned away from the door like this. If you will not
      admit him I will go outside and hear what it is that he has to say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In his heart the Squire held Ida in some awe. He looked at her, and saw
      that her eyes were flashing and her breast heaving. Then he gave way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well, since my daughter insists on it, pray come in,&rdquo;
      and he bowed. &ldquo;If such an intrusion falls in with your ideas of
      decency it is not for me to complain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept your invitation,&rdquo; answered Harold, looking very
      angry, &ldquo;because I have something to say which you must hear, and
      hear at once. No, thank you, I will stand. Now, Mr. de la Molle, it is
      this, wonderful as it may seem. It has been my fortune to discover the
      treasure hidden by Sir James de la Molle in the year 1643!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a general gasp of astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>What!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed the Squire. &ldquo;Why, I thought
      that the whole thing was a myth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that it ain&rsquo;t, sir,&rdquo; said George with a melancholy
      smile, &ldquo;cos I&rsquo;ve seen it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida had sunk into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the amount?&rdquo; she asked in a low eager voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been unable to calculate exactly, but, speaking roughly, it
      cannot be under fifty thousand pounds, estimated on the value of the gold
      alone. Here is a specimen of it,&rdquo; and Harold pulled out a handful of
      rials and other coins, and poured them on to the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida hid her face in her hand, and Edward Cossey realising what this most
      unexpected development of events might mean for him, began to tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not allow myself to be too much elated, Mr. de la Molle,&rdquo;
      he said with a sneer, &ldquo;for even if this tale be true, it is treasure
      trove, and belongs to the Crown.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the Squire, &ldquo;I never thought of that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have,&rdquo; answered the Colonel quietly. &ldquo;If I
      remember right, the last of the original de la Molles left a will in which
      he especially devised this treasure, hidden by his father, to your
      ancestor. That it is the identical treasure I am fortunately in a position
      to prove by this parchment,&rdquo; and he laid upon the table the writing
      he had found with the gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right&mdash;quite right,&rdquo; said the Squire, &ldquo;that
      will take it out of the custom.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps the Solicitor to the Treasury may hold a different opinion,&rdquo;
      said Cossey, with another sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then Ida took her hand from her face. There was a dewy look about her
      eyes, and the last ripples of a happy smile lingered round the corners of
      her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that we have heard what Colonel Quaritch had to say,&rdquo; she
      said in her softest voice, and addressing her father, &ldquo;there is no
      reason why we should not finish our business with Mr. Cossey.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Harold and George turned to go. She waved them back imperiously, and
      began speaking before any one could interfere, taking up her speech where
      she had broken it off when she caught sight of the Colonel and George
      coming up the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can no longer hesitate,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but once and for
      all I decline to marry you, Mr. Cossey, and I hope that I shall never see
      your face again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this announcement the bewildered Squire put his hand to his head.
      Edward Cossey staggered visibly and rested himself against the table,
      while George murmured audibly, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good job.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Ida, rising from her chair, her dark eyes
      flashing as the shadow of all the shame and agony that she had undergone
      rose up within her mind. &ldquo;Listen, Mr. Cossey,&rdquo; and she pointed
      her finger at him; &ldquo;this is the history of our connection. Some
      months ago I was so foolish as to ask your help in the matter of the
      mortgages which your bank was calling in. You then practically made terms
      that if it should at any time be your wish I should become engaged to you;
      and I, seeing no option, accepted. Then, in the interval, while it was
      inconvenient to you to enforce those terms, I gave my affection elsewhere.
      But when you, having deserted the lady who stood in your way&mdash;no, do
      not interrupt me, I know it, I know it all, I know it from her own lips&mdash;came
      forward and claimed my promise, I was forced to consent. But a loophole of
      escape presented itself and I availed myself of it. What followed? You
      again became possessed of power over my father and this place, you
      insulted the man I loved, you resorted to every expedient that the law
      would allow to torture my father and myself. You set your lawyers upon us
      like dogs upon a hare, you held ruin over us and again and again you
      offered me money, as much money as I wished, if only I would sell myself
      to you. And then you bided your time, leaving despair to do its work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw the toils closing round us. I knew that if I did not yield my
      father would be driven from his home in his old age, and that the place he
      loved would pass to strangers&mdash;would pass to you. No, father, do not
      stop me, I <i>will</i> speak my mind!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And at last I determined that cost what it might I would yield.
      Whether I could have carried out my determination God only knows. I almost
      think that I should have killed myself upon my marriage day. I made up my
      mind. Not five minutes ago the very words were upon my lips that would
      have sealed my fate, when deliverance came. And now <i>go</i>. I have done
      with you. Your money shall be paid to you, capital and interest, down to
      the last farthing. I tender back my price, and knowing you for what you
      are, I&mdash;I despise you. That is all I have to say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if that beant a master one,&rdquo; ejaculated George aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida, who had never looked more beautiful than she did in this moment of
      passion, turned to seat herself, but the tension of her feelings and the
      torrent of her wrath and eloquence had been too much for her. She would
      have fallen had not Harold, who had been listening amazed to this
      overpowering outburst of nature, run up and caught her in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Edward Cossey, he had shrunk back involuntarily beneath the volume
      of her scorn, till he stood with his back against the panelled wall. His
      face was white as a sheet; despair and fury shone in his dark eyes. Never
      had he desired this woman more fiercely than he did now, in the moment
      when he knew that she had escaped him for ever. In a sense he was to be
      pitied, for passion tore his heart in twain. For a moment he stood thus.
      Then with a spring rather than a step, he advanced across the room till he
      was face to face with Harold, who, with Ida still half fainting in his
      arms, and her head upon his shoulder, was standing on the further side of
      the fire-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I owe this to you&mdash;you
      half-pay adventurer,&rdquo; and he lifted his arm as though to strike him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, none of that,&rdquo; said the Squire, speaking for the first
      time. &ldquo;I will have no brawling here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; put in George, edging his long form between the two,
      &ldquo;and begging your pardon, sir, don&rsquo;t you go a-calling of
      better men than yourself adwenturers. At any rate, if the Colonel is an
      adwenturer, he hev adwentured to some purpose, as is easy for to see,&rdquo;
      and he pointed to Ida.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your tongue, sir,&rdquo; roared the Squire, as usual relieving
      his feelings on his retainer. &ldquo;You are always shoving your oar in
      where it isn&rsquo;t wanted.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Squire, all right,&rdquo; said George the imperturbable;
      &ldquo;thin his manners shouldn&rsquo;t be sich.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to allow this?&rdquo; said Cossey, turning fiercely to
      the old gentleman. &ldquo;Do you mean to allow this man to marry your
      daughter for her money?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Cossey,&rdquo; answered the Squire, with his politest and most
      old-fashioned bow, &ldquo;whatever sympathy I may have felt for you is
      being rapidly alienated by your manner. I told you that my daughter must
      speak for herself. She has spoken very clearly indeed, and, in short, I
      have absolutely nothing to add to her words.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you what it is,&rdquo; Cossey said, shaking with fury,
      &ldquo;I have been tricked and fooled and played with, and so surely as
      there is a heaven above us I will have my revenge on you all. The money
      which this man says that he has found belongs to the Queen, not to you,
      and I will take care that the proper people are informed of it before you
      can make away with it. When that is taken from you, if, indeed, the whole
      thing is not a trick, we shall see what will happen to you. I tell you
      that I will take this property and I will pull this old place you are so
      fond of down stone by stone and throw it into the moat, and send the
      plough over the site. I will sell the estate piecemeal and blot it out. I
      tell you I have been tricked&mdash;you encouraged the marriage yourself,
      you know you did, and forbade that man the house,&rdquo; and he paused for
      breath and to collect his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the Squire bowed, and his bow was a study in itself. You do not see
      such bows now-a-days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One minute, Mr. Cossey,&rdquo; he said very quietly, for it was one
      of his peculiarities to become abnormally quiet in circumstances of real
      emergency, &ldquo;and then I think that we may close this painful
      interview. When first I knew you I did not like you. Afterwards, through
      various circumstances, I modified my opinion and set my dislike down to
      prejudice. You are quite right in saying that I encouraged the idea of a
      marriage between you and my daughter, also that I forbade the house to
      Colonel Quaritch. I did so because, to be honest, I saw no other way of
      avoiding the utter ruin of my family; but perhaps I was wrong in so doing.
      I hope that you may never be placed in a position which will force you to
      such a decision. Also at the time, indeed never till this moment, have I
      quite realised how the matter really stood. I did not understand how
      strongly my daughter was attached in another direction, perhaps I was
      unwilling to understand it. Nor did I altogether understand the course of
      action by which it seems you obtained a promise of marriage from my
      daughter in the first instance. I was anxious for the marriage because I
      believed you to be a better man than you are, also because I thought that
      it would place my daughter and her descendants in a much improved
      position, and that she would in time become attached to you. I forbade
      Colonel Quaritch the house because I considered that an alliance with him
      would be undesirable for everybody concerned. I find that in all this I
      was acting wrongly, and I frankly admit it. Perhaps as we grow old we grow
      worldly also, and you and your agents pressed me very hard, Mr. Cossey.
      Still I have always told you that my daughter was a free agent and must
      decide for herself, and therefore I owe you no apology on this score. So
      much then for the question of your engagement to Miss de la Molle. It is
      done with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now as regards the threats you make. I shall try to meet them as
      occasion arises, and if I cannot do so it will be my misfortune. But one
      thing they show me, though I am sorry to have to say it to any man in a
      house which I can still call my own&mdash;they show me that my first
      impressions of you were the correct ones. <i>You are not a gentleman</i>,
      Mr. Cossey, and I must beg to decline the honour of your further
      acquaintance,&rdquo; and with another bow he opened the vestibule door and
      stood holding the handle in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward Cossey looked round with a stare of rage. Then muttering one most
      comprehensive curse he stalked from the room, and in another minute was
      driving fast through the ancient gateway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us pity him, for he also certainly received his due.
    </p>
    <p>
      George followed him to the outer door and then did a thing that nobody had
      seen him do before; he burst out into a loud laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you making that noise about?&rdquo; asked his master
      sternly. &ldquo;This is no laughing matter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Him!</i>&rdquo; replied George, pointing to the retreating
      dog-cart&mdash;&ldquo;<i>he&rsquo;s</i> a-going to pull down the Castle
      and throw it into the moat and to send the plough over it, is he? <i>Him</i>&mdash;that
      varmint! Why, them old towers will be a-standing there when his beggarly
      bones is dust, and when his name ain&rsquo;t no more a name; and there&rsquo;ll
      be one of the old blood sitting in them too. I knaw it, and I hev allus
      knawed it. Come, Squire, though you allus du say how as I&rsquo;m a fule,
      what did I tell yer? Didn&rsquo;t I tell yer that Prowidence weren&rsquo;t
      a-going to let this place go to any laryers or bankers or thim sort? Why,
      in course I did. And now you see. Not but what it is all owing to the
      Colonel. He was the man as found it, but then God Almighty taught him
      where to dig. But he&rsquo;s a good un, he is; and a gintleman, not like
      <i>him</i>,&rdquo; and once more he pointed with unutterable scorn to the
      road down which Edward Cossey had vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, look here,&rdquo; said the Squire, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you
      stand talking all day about things you don&rsquo;t understand. That&rsquo;s
      the way you waste time. You be off and look after this gold; it should not
      be left alone, you know. We will come down presently to Molehill, for I
      suppose that is where it is. No, I can&rsquo;t stop to hear the story now,
      and besides I want Colonel Quaritch to tell it to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Squire,&rdquo; said George, touching his red nightcap,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be off,&rdquo; and he started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George,&rdquo; halloaed his master after him, but George did not
      stop. He had a trick of deafness when the Squire was calling, that is if
      he wanted to go somewhere else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound you,&rdquo; roared the old gentleman, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t
      you stop when I call you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This time George brought his long lank frame to a standstill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg pardon, Squire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg pardon, yes&mdash;you&rsquo;re always begging pardon. Look
      here, you had better bring your wife and have dinner in the servants&rsquo;
      hall to-day, and drink a glass of port.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Squire,&rdquo; said George again, touching his red
      nightcap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And look here, George. Give me your hand, man. Here&rsquo;s a merry
      Christmas to you. We&rsquo;ve gone through some queerish times about this
      place together, but now it almost looks as though we were going to end our
      days in peace and plenty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Same to you, Squire, I&rsquo;m sure, same to you,&rdquo; said
      George, pulling off his cap. &ldquo;Yes, yes, we&rsquo;ve had some bad
      years, what with poor Mr. James and that Quest and Cossey (he&rsquo;s the
      master varmint of the lot he is), and the bad times, and Janter, and the
      Moat Farm and all. But, bless you, Squire, now that there&rsquo;ll be some
      ready money and no debts, why, if I don&rsquo;t make out somehow so that
      you all get a good living out of the place I&rsquo;m a Dutchman. Why, yes,
      it&rsquo;s been a bad time and we&rsquo;re a-getting old, but there, that&rsquo;s
      how it is, the sky almost allus clears toward night-fall. God Almighty hev
      a mind to let one down easy, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you would talk a little less about your Maker, and come to
      church a little more, it would be a good thing, as I&rsquo;ve told you
      before,&rdquo; said the Squire; &ldquo;but there, go along with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the honest fellow went.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIV. &mdash; CHRISTMAS CHIMES
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Squire turned and entered the house. He generally was fairly noisy in
      his movements, but on this occasion he was exceptionally so. Possibly he
      had a reason for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the vestibule he found Harold and Ida standing side by side as
      though they were being drilled. It was impossible to resist the conclusion
      that they had suddenly assumed that attitude because it happened to be the
      first position into which they could conveniently fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s silence, then Harold took Ida&rsquo;s hand and
      led her up to where her father was standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. de la Molle,&rdquo; he said simply, &ldquo;once more I ask you
      for your daughter in marriage. I am quite aware of my many
      disqualifications, especially those of my age and the smallness of my
      means; but Ida and myself hope and believe that under all the
      circumstances you will no longer withhold your consent,&rdquo; and he
      paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quaritch,&rdquo; answered the Squire, &ldquo;I have already in your
      presence told Mr. Cossey under what circumstances I was favourably
      inclined to his proposal, so I need not repeat all that. As regards your
      means, although they would have been quite insufficient to avert the ruin
      which threatened us, still you have, I believe, a competence, and owing to
      your wonderful and most providential discovery the fear of ruin seems to
      have passed away. It is owing to you that this discovery, which by the way
      I want to hear all about, has been made; had it not been for you it never
      would have been made at all, and therefore I certainly have no right to
      say anything more about your means. As to your age, well, after all
      forty-four is not the limit of life, and if Ida does not object to
      marrying a man of those years, I cannot object to her doing so. With
      reference to your want of occupation, I think that if you marry Ida this
      place will, as times are, keep your hands pretty full, especially when you
      have an obstinate donkey like that fellow George to deal with. I am
      getting too old and stupid to look after it myself, and besides things are
      so topsy-turvy that I can&rsquo;t understand them. There is one thing more
      that I want to say: I forbade you the house. Well, you are a
      generous-minded man, and it is human to err, so I think that perhaps you
      will understand my action and not bear me a grudge on that account. Also,
      I dare say that at the time, and possibly at other times, I said things I
      should be sorry for if I could remember what they were, which I can&rsquo;t,
      and if so, I apologise to you as a gentleman ought when he finds himself
      in the wrong. And so I say God bless you both, and I hope you will be
      happy in life together; and now come here, Ida, my love, and give me a
      kiss. You have been a good daughter all your life, and so Quaritch may be
      sure that you will be a good wife too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida did as she was bid. Then she went over to her lover and took him by
      his hand, and he kissed her on the forehead. And thus after all their
      troubles they finally ratified the contract.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      And we, who have followed them thus far, and have perhaps been a little
      moved by their struggles, hopes, and fears, will surely not grudge to
      re-echo the Squire&rsquo;s old-fashioned prayer, &ldquo;God bless them
      both.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      God bless them both. Long may they live, and happily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long may they live, and for very long may their children&rsquo;s children
      of the race, if not of the name of de la Molle, pass in and out through
      the old Norman gateway and by the sturdy Norman towers. The Boisseys, who
      built them, here had their habitation for six generations. The de la
      Molles who wedded the heiress of the Boisseys lived here for thirteen
      generations. May the Quaritchs whose ancestor married Ida, heiress of the
      de la Molles, endure as long!
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely it is permitted to us to lift a corner of the curtain of futurity
      and in spirit see Ida Quaritch, stately and beautiful as we knew her, but
      of a happier countenance. We see her seated on some Christmas Eve to come
      in the drawing-room of the Castle, telling to the children at her knees
      the wonderful tale of how their father and old George on this very night,
      when the gale blew long years ago, discovered the ruddy pile of gold,
      hoarded in that awful storehouse amid the bones of Saxon or Danish heroes,
      and thus saved her to be their mother. We can see their wide wondering
      eyes and fixed faces, as for the tenth time they listen to a story before
      which the joys of Crusoe will grow pale. We can hear the eager appeal for
      details made to the military-looking gentleman, very grizzled now, but
      grown better-looking with the advancing years, who is standing before the
      fire, the best, most beloved husband and father in all that country side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps there may be a vacant chair, and another tomb among the ranks of
      the departed de la Molles; perhaps the ancient walls will no longer echo
      to the sound of the Squire&rsquo;s stentorian voice. And what of that? It
      is our common lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he goes the country side will lose a man of whom they will not
      see the like again, for the breed is dead or dying; a man whose very
      prejudices, inconsistencies, and occasional wrong-headed violence will be
      held, when he is no longer here, to have been endearing qualities. And for
      manliness, for downright English God-fearing virtues, for love of Queen,
      country, family and home, they may search in vain to find his equal among
      the cosmopolitan Englishmen of the dawning twentieth century. His faults
      were many, and at one time he went near to sacrificing his daughter to
      save his house, but he would not have been the man he was without them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so to him, too, farewell. Perchance he will find himself better placed
      in the Valhalla of his forefathers, surrounded by those stout old de la
      Molles whose memory he regarded with so much affection, than here in this
      thin-blooded Victorian era. For as has been said elsewhere the old Squire
      would undoubtedly have looked better in a chain shirt and bearing a battle
      axe than ever he did in a frock coat, especially with his retainer George
      armed to the teeth behind him.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      They kissed, and it was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out from the church tower in the meadows broke with clash and clangour a
      glad sound of Christmas bells. Out it swept over layer, pitle and fallow,
      over river, plantain, grove and wood. It floated down the valley of the
      Ell, it beat against Dead Man&rsquo;s Mount (henceforth to the vulgar mind
      more haunted than ever), it echoed up the Castle&rsquo;s Norman towers and
      down the oak-clad vestibule. Away over the common went the glad message of
      Earth&rsquo;s Saviour, away high into the air, startling the rooks upon
      their airy courses, as though the iron notes of the World&rsquo;s
      rejoicing would fain float to the throned feet of the World&rsquo;s
      Everlasting King.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peace and goodwill! Ay and happiness to the children of men while their
      span is, and hope for the Beyond, and heaven&rsquo;s blessing on holy love
      and all good things that are. This is what those liquid notes seemed to
      say to the most happy pair who stood hand in hand in the vestibule and
      thought on all they had escaped and all that they had won.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Quaritch, if you and Ida have quite done staring at each
      other, which isn&rsquo;t very interesting to a third party, perhaps you
      will not mind telling us how you happened on old Sir James de la Molle&rsquo;s
      hoard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus adjured, Harold began his thrilling story, telling the whole history
      of the night in detail, and if his hearers had expected to be astonished
      certainly their expectations were considerably more than fulfilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; said the Squire when he had done, &ldquo;I
      think I am beginning to grow superstitious in my old age. Hang me if I don&rsquo;t
      believe it was the finger of Providence itself that pointed out those
      letters to you. Anyway, I&rsquo;m off to see the spoil. Run and get your
      hat, Ida, my dear, and we will all go together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And they went and looked at the chest full of red gold, yes, and passed
      down, all three of them, into those chill presences in the bowels of the
      Mount. Then coming thence awed and silent they sealed up the place for
      ever.

    <h2>
      CONCLUSION
    </h2>
    <h3>
      GOOD-BYE
    </h3>
    <p>
      On the following morning such of the inhabitants of Boisingham as chanced
      to be about were much interested to see an ordinary farm tumbrel coming
      down the main street. It was being driven, or rather led, by no less a
      person than George himself, while behind it walked the well-known form of
      the old Squire, arm-in-arm with Colonel Quaritch.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were still more interested, however, when the tumbrel drew up at the
      door of the bank&mdash;not Cossey&rsquo;s, but the opposition bank&mdash;where,
      although it was Boxing Day, the manager and the clerk were apparently
      waiting for its arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      But their interest culminated when they perceived that the cart only
      contained a few bags, and yet that each of these bags seemed to require
      three or four men to lift it with any comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus was the gold safely housed. Upon being weighed its value was found to
      be about fifty-three thousand pounds of modern money. But as some of the
      coins were exceedingly rare, and of great worth to museums and collectors,
      this value was considerably increased, and the treasure was ultimately
      sold for fifty-six thousand two hundred and fifty-four pounds. Only Ida
      kept back enough of the choicest coins to make a gold waistband or girdle
      and a necklace for herself, destined no doubt in future days to form the
      most cherished heirloom of the Quaritch family.
    </p>
    <p>
      On that same evening the Squire and Harold went to London and opened up
      communications with the Solicitor to the Treasury. Fortunately they were
      able to refer to the will of Sir Edward de la Molle, the second baronet,
      in which he specially devised to his cousin, Geoffrey Dofferleigh, and his
      heirs for ever, not only his estates, but his lands, &ldquo;together with
      the treasure hid thereon or elsewhere by my late murdered father, Sir
      James de la Molle.&rdquo; Also they produced the writing which Ida had
      found in the old Bible, and the parchment discovered by George among the
      coin. These three documents formed a chain of evidence which even
      officials interested for the Treasury could not refuse to admit, and in
      the upshot the Crown renounced its claims, and the property in the gold
      passed to the Squire, subject to the payment of the same succession duty
      which he would have been called upon to meet had he inherited a like sum
      from a cousin at the present time.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it came to pass that when the mortgage money was due it was paid to
      the last farthing, capital and interest, and Edward Cossey lost his hold
      upon Honham for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Edward Cossey himself, we may say one more word about him. In the
      course of time he sufficiently recovered from his violent passion for Ida
      to allow him to make a brilliant marriage with the only daughter of an
      impecunious peer. She keeps her name and title and he plays the part of
      the necessary husband. Anyhow, my reader, if it is your fortune to
      frequent the gilded saloons of the great, you may meet Lady Honoria
      Tallton and Mr. Cossey. If you do meet him, however, it may be as well to
      avoid him, for the events of his life have not been of a nature to improve
      his temper. This much then of Edward Cossey.
    </p>
    <p>
      If after leaving the gilded saloons aforesaid you should happen to wander
      through the London streets, you may meet another character in this
      history. You may see a sweet pale face, still stamped with a child-like
      roundness and simplicity, but half hidden in the coarse hood of the nun.
      You may see her, and if you care to follow you may find what is the work
      wherein she seeks her peace. It would shock you; but it is her work of
      mercy and loving kindness and she does it unflinchingly. Among her sister
      nuns there is no one more beloved than Sister Agnes. So good-bye to her
      also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold Quaritch and Ida were married in the spring and the village
      children strewed the churchyard path with primroses and violets&mdash;the
      same path where in anguish of soul they had met and parted on that dreary
      winter&rsquo;s night.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there at the old church door, when the wreath is on her brow and the
      veil about her face, let us bid farewell to Ida and her husband, Harold
      Quaritch.
    </p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm collection.
Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works, and the
medium on which they may be stored, may contain "Defects," such as, but
not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription
errors, a copyright or other intellectual property infringement, a
defective or damaged disk or other medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees.
YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY,
BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN
PARAGRAPH F3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE TRADEMARK OWNER, AND

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain
freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and
permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To
learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and
how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the
Foundation web page at http:__www.pglaf.org.


Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing
the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely
distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array
of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to
$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with
the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit http:__pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside
the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways
including including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http:__pglaf.org_donate


Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless
a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks
in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http:__www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including
how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to
our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date. If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just download
by the etext year. For example:

    (Or _etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way. The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path. The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename). The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename. For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http:__www.gutenberg.net_1_0_2_3_10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http:__www.gutenberg.net_2_4_6_8_24689
